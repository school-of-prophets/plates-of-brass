chapter-aka: The Birth of Two Nations

1. And this is the remembrance of the generations of Joseph, the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham; which account was written by the hand of Moses by the Word of YHVH{a}:
[a] Known as the Tetragrammaton; see YHVH

2. And it came to pass that as Rachel, the wife of Jacob, went drawing water from the well, the angel of YHVH{a} came before her saying: Fear not handmaiden of YHVH, for thou are a chosen vessel to bear a choice branch unto YHVH.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

3. And Rachel said unto the angel of YHVH: I know not what you say, my Lord{a}.
[a] Adonai: Hebrew. “Lord;” This use is likely because it was the angel of YHVH speaking to her and she was then addressing the angel; see Adonai

4. And the angel said unto her: Jacob, thy husband, shall be a tree of life reaching unto all the earth; yea, and over the high walls shall his branches reach, even unto the isles of the sea which are afar off;

5. And his seed shall rule all lands and trample down all people, for YHVH{a}, Elohim Shaddai{b} shall make strong his seed.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim Shaddai

6. Rachel, see that thy reproach is taken away from thee; and thou shalt bare a son, and thou shalt call his name Joseph{a};
[a] Yosef; Hebrew, “God will give” or “He will add"

7. For YHVH, the Elohim of you and of your seed, shall make of him two great nations, yea, even mighty nations before YHVH.

8. ¶ And after she had seen and heard these things, Rachel ran down unto her husband Jacob and said unto him: YHVH hath taken away my reproach, and hath opened up my womb,

9. And I shall bare thee a son, which we shall call Joseph, and he shall be two great and mighty nations before YHVH!

10. ¶ And when Jacob heard he knew not what to think, but he went and did make and offering unto YHVH.

11. Then Jacob cried out, saying: O YHVH Elohim{a}, yea, even El Elyon{b}, the Creator{c} of the heavens and the earth, surely through my seed shall Ye show Thyself faithful of the promises made unto my fathers!
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon
[c] Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh: The Creator, or "I AM that I AM,"or "I AM (the One) that Makes/ Creates;" see Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

12. And YHVH did hear Jacob, and the angel of YHVH did appeared unto Jacob over the offering saying: Jacob, Jacob, YHVH is well pleased with thee!

13. Thou shall be given a son, and ye{a} shall call his name Joseph, for he shall be a great and mighty nation before YHVH;
[a] Ye is old english for plural "you;" this indicates that both the father and the mother would name their son

14. And out of the loins of thy son, Joseph, shall YHVH bring many sons and daughters into His glory, and salvation unto many of thy seed and all of the seed of thy father, Abraham.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Rachel did bring forth a son, and they called his name Joseph.

16. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH appeared unto Jacob in a dream saying: Jacob, thy son Joseph shall be two great and mighty nations in the hand of YHVH;

17. And these nations shall be greater than any nations upon the face of the earth; and yet only a remnant shall see my face and live.

18. Behold, wisdom shall increase in the latter days and mankind shall make mighty weapons of war; yea, even terrible weapons which shall touch the power of El Elyon;

19. And the seed of Joseph shall believe a lie, even that the terrible weapons shall be had for to make peace, and for the protection of their lands;

20. And woe unto them, for the people shall be deceived!

21. ¶ And then Jacob awoke, and the spirit of YHVH{a} took Jacob, and showed unto him a vision, saying: Behold, the mighty men of the earth shall lay an awful scheme by the word of their god;
[a] See Spirit of YHVH

22. Yea, even that they should destroy YHVH in that day that He shall visit mankind to judge the sons of men and reward them according to their works.

23. And all nations shall gather as one in the heart of the earth to make war with YHVH, even the almighty King of the heavens and of the earth.

24. Woe, woe, woe unto the chief princes of the earth, who have made gold their god and a lie their refuge!

25. For they have said among themselves: YHVH is no god that we should fear; for by our mighty power have we become gods ourselves and have spread abroad over all of the earth!

26. Yet they shall be judged and cut off from among the sons of Jacob, sayeth YHVH, for the wicked plot in vain.

27. And they shall drink from the cup of vanity which they have grasped: for I, YHVH, shall utterly destroy them all by the very light of my presence.

28. And lo, those who plot in vain have over them a king; even he whose name is the liar from the beginning, even that Adversary{a}, he who was a morning star{b} in my presence.
[a] See Satan
[b] Hebrew, "Helel;" male noun, "a shining one."

29. But this Satan{a} shall be bound, that accuser{a}; even he who has granted them their great authority;
[a] See Satan

30. And so too shall Lilith{a}, that serpent that giveth them their crowns{b} and who hath whispered lies into their ears like a cunning serpent which lieth in the dust.
[a] Aa female night demon, usually translated into "owl" in many English versions of the Bible; see Book of Remembrance 5:25, and Lilith
[b] See Zenos 3:13-17

31. And YHVH shall come and bind them with cords which cannot be loosed, and seal them up with a seal which cannot be broken;

32. For these have led them astray by their foolish wisdom, which has become folly in the sight of heaven.

33. Woe unto them! For they have tried to lay waste to Eden{a}, the very garden of Elohim{b}, and made the inhabitants of the earth to stumble exceedingly, causing them to be drunk{c} from the cup of blindness, and to feast from the table{d} of their rebellion;
[a] Hebrew, a name for the Divine Feminine, the Creation, and the Earth; see Eden
[b] Hebrew, "garden of the gods;" likely the garden of Eden or the creation itself, or both
[c] See Zenos 3:10
[d] See Zenos 12:1

34. Therefore, comfort thyselves with these words, my beloved Israel, for verily, I, YHVH, reign supreme over all elohim{a} and shall swiftly bring justice which cannot be overthrown.
[a] Hebrew, "gods"

35. And Jacob was astonished at all YHVH had shown him: for weak was his understanding, and without strength was his soul in the presence of YHVH.

chapter-aka: The Dreamer of Dreams

1. And it came to pass that Joseph, the son of Rachel and Jacob, grew in stature; and Joseph was a peculiar child, full of knowledge{a} and wisdom{b}.
[a] Knowledge can represent God the Father
[b] Wisdom representing God the Mother

2. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{a} appeared unto Jacob saying: Make a tunic{b} for thy son Joseph, and place on it the holy emblems{c} of the priesthood of YHVH, thy Elohim{d}.
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] A garment, coat, or cloak; see 4 Moses 32:6- 21, Tunic, and Coat of many colors
[c] See 4 Moses 32:8
[d] See Elohim

3. And thou shall lay thy hands upon him and ordain him to be a High Priest unto El Elyon{a}; and instruct him in the hidden wisdom of YHVH{b};
[a] Hebrew, "Most High God;" see El Elyon
[b] See YHVH

4. Yea, even the hidden treasures of knowledge, which have been known among your fathers, as given{a} unto thy father Abraham, and thy mother Sarah of my servant Melchizedek;
[a] See 1 Moses 27

5. For I shall cause thy son Joseph to go down into a land full of idolatry and iniquity, and there I shall cause him to be a messiah among the people for the sake of thy seed.

6. And he shall bare the power of El Elyon{a}, and he shall become a mighty ruler among them.
[a] See El Elyon

7. And through him shall I, YHVH, bless whomsoever he shall bless, and curse whomsoever he shall curse; for my name shall be in him;

8. And great shall be his name in that land; wherefore, their king shall know that he is Tzadik Yachad{a}.
[a] Joseph is being called a Messiah, an anointed one; see Tzadik Yachad

9. And behold, he shall seal up the blessings of the Holy Priesthood for the generations which are afar off:

10. That Elyon{a} may have witness for Himself in the last days, before the great and final day when YHVH himself shall come and reward the sons of men{b} according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil; even so must it be, Amen.
[a] Hebrew, "The Most High;" see El Elyon
[b] See Sons of men

11. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob made a tunic, even a coat of many colors{a}, according to the Word of YHVH, and he placed it upon his son Joseph.
[a] Hebrew, "tunic;" see Tunic, Coat of many colors

12. And Jacob did bless him with all of the hidden blessings of wisdom instructed him in the secret knowledge of YHVH, whereunto Joseph should be a High Priest of El Elyon, even at a young age.

13. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father did reside, even the land of Canaan.

14. Now Jacob loved Joseph, the son of his old age; and when his brethren saw that their father had ordained him a High Priest of YHVH and made him a coat of many colors, they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph dreamed a dream{a}, and he told it his brethren; and they hated him yet the more.
[a] Or "was given a vision in a dream"

16. And he said unto them: Hear, I pray ye, this dream which I have dreamed;

17. For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood round about and made obedience unto my sheaf.

18. And his brethren said to him: Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Which is to say: Shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?

19. And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that he dreamed yet another dream{a}, and told it his brethren, and said: Behold, I have dreamed a dream more;
[a] Or "was given anther vision in a dream"

21. And behold, the sun{a}, and the moon{b}, and the eleven stars{c} made obedience unto me.
[a] The sun likely represents Jacob, Joseph's father
[b] The moon likely represents Rachel, Joseph's mother
[c] The stars likely represent Joseph's brothers

22. And he told it unto his father and to his mother, and unto his brethren, and their sister;

23. And his father rebuked him and said unto him: What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?

24. Shall I, and thy mother, and thy brethren, indeed, come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

25. But once Joseph departed, Jacob turned unto his other sons, and rebuked them saying: Joseph is a chosen vessel whom YHVH hath chosen, and it is according to His purposes.

26. And: Who are you that you dare accuse El Elyon? Truly, YHVH hath chosen him for His own purposes and ye shall well abide under it, for this is the Word of YHVH.

27. And when Jacob had finished speaking, his sons murmured among themselves; and his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.

28. ¶ And it came to pass that his brethren went to feed the flock of their father in Shechem.

29. And Joseph, being but fourteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives.

30. And it came to pass that they did mock Joseph, their brother, and placed a heavy burden upon him that he might know their displeasure.

31. And Joseph left them, and they mocked as he went his way; and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.

32. And repenting, Jacob came again unto his son, Joseph saying: Fear not my son, as YHVH hath decreed His decree, thou shall be a prince over me and all my house:

33. Yet pride has filled thy heart; therefore, let no boasting be found at all in thy mouth, yea, neither in thy heart, lest thou fall under condemnation:

34. For YHVH Elohim{a} hateth a proud and boastful heart; yea, and thou did come into this world naked{b}, and thou shall leave it naked;
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] Or "you came into this world with nothing and you will leave it with nothing"

35. Wherefore, remember this, my son: YHVH exalts whom He will, and YHVH abases whom He will;

36. Therefore, thou shall keep thy heart humble before El Elyon all the days of thy life.

37. And Joseph was pierced in his heart{a} and dared not open his mouth to ever boast again.
[a] The pierced heart is a sincere plea to God inscribed in our very souls; see Pierced heart

chapter-aka: Brothers against Brother

1. And it came to pass that Jacob said unto Joseph: Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them.

2. And Joseph said unto him: Here am I.

3. And Jacob said unto Joseph: Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks; and bring me word again.

4. And thus did Jacob send Joseph out of the vale{a} of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
[a] Or "valley"

5. ¶ And a certain man found him, and behold, there he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying: What seekest thou?

6. And Joseph said: I seek my brethren; tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.

7. And the man said: They are departed hence; for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothan.

8. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.

9. And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him, to slay him.

10. And they said one to another: Behold, this dreamer cometh! Come now, therefore, and let us slay him and cast him into some pit;

11. And we will say: Some evil beast hath devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

12. ¶ And it came to pass that when Joseph approached his brethren they made as to worship him and mocked him, saying: Have mercy on us O king! Save us, O mighty one!

13. And they seized upon Joseph, and Dan drew his sword as to kill him and thrust it into the side of Joseph, yet it pierced not his flesh; and they were all astonished.

14. And Reuben heard it; and he delivered him out of their hands and said: Let us not kill him.

15. And Reuben said unto them: Truly, YHVH{a} hath chosen him, and the power of Elyon{b} dwells with him;
[a] See YHVH
[b] Hebrew, "The Most High;" see El Elyon

16. Therefore, shed not his blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and we shall lay no hand upon him, that we might rid him out of our hands, to deliver him to our father again.

17. ¶ And it came to pass that they stripped Joseph out of his tunic, his coat of many colors{a} that was on him; and they took him and cast him into a pit;
[a] See Tunic 

18. And the pit was empty; for there was no water in it.

19. And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked; and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.

20. And Judah said unto his brethren: What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?

21. Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh; and his brethren were content.

22. Then there passed by the Midianites, merchantmen; and the brothers of Joseph drew him up and lifted Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver; and these merchantmen brought Joseph into Egypt.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that Reuben returned to the pit; and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes,

24. And he returned unto his brethren, and said: The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?

25. And they took the coat of Joseph, and killed a kid of the goats, and they dipped the coat in the blood;

26. And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said: This have we found; know now whether it be the coat of thy son or no.

27. And Jacob knew it and said: It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

28. And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

29. And all the sons and all the daughters{a} of Jacob rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted.
[a] "All the sons and all the daughters" implies that Jacob had more than one daughter, this likely refers to the men, women, and children in his household not related by blood

30. And Jacob said: I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning; and so did Jacob, his father, weep for him.

chapter-aka: Israel in Bondage

1. And it came to pass that after the band of Midianites had departed, the chief of the Midianites, whose name was Chanoch{a} said unto Joseph: I see a great evil hath befallen thee; and by what means then doth thy brethren hateth thee so?
[a] Hebrew: "dedicated"

2. And Joseph said unto him: It mattereth not, but know that I shall honor the word of my kin, for I shall serve thee all the days of my life for it is the will of El Elyon{a} that I should go with you.
[a] See El Elyon

3. And Chanoch replied saying: So shall it be.

4. And Joseph spoke again unto Chanoch saying: But I pray thee, go unto the house of my Father, Jacob, and tell my father where thou shall take me, that he worry not for my safety, and that he shall see for himself that I am gone willingly.

5. For the angel of YHVH{a} had come unto Joseph whilst he was in the pit and said unto him: Joseph, I have heard thy murmurings and witnessed thy afflictions, I saw thy tears, and I know thy misery.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

6. And I am grieved for thy sake, and thy affliction is added to the burden of my afflictions;

7. Therefore, put thy trust in El Elyon, and fear not, for YHVH{a} is with thee, and shall deliver thee from all evil.
[a] See YHVH

8. And now, behold, thou shall go down into Egypt{a} with thy masters; but fear not, for YHVH is with thee.
[a] Egypt can represent the things of this world; see Egypt

9. And now, thou art a High Priest{a} of El Elyon, and thou shall become a mighty ruler among the Egyptians{b}.
[a] See 2 Moses 2:11-12
[b] Egyptians can represent our wordly desires

10. And I say unto thee that YHVH shall bless whomsoever thou shall bless, and curse whomsoever thou shall curse for HaShem{a} shall be in thee.
[a] Hebrew, literally "The Name." In the Egyptian, this could be translated as "the name of ntr ("god's word" or "divine word") Ra," Ra is the Egyptian creator god; in Hebrew the translation  would be "the name El." The translation used, HaShem, was used based on inspiration from the Lord to the translator

11. And great shall be thy name in the land; wherefore Pharaoh shall know that thou art a prince of Elohim{a}.
[a] See Elohim

12. And many other things did the angel of YHVH say unto Joseph; therefore, he feared not but put his faith in YHVH Elohim{a}.
[a] See YHVH Elohim

13. ¶ And it came to pass that Chanoch now feared that the brothers of Joseph had tricked him, and he feared reprisal from their father Jacob;

14. Therefore, Chanoch did command one of his sons to take a servant and go to Jacob, that Jacob might know that which had befallen his son, Joseph.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that when they came unto the house of Jacob, that they saw that Jacob wept bitterly;

16. And the son for Chanoch and his servant fled the house of Jacob, without fulfilling their obligation.

17. But the son of Chanoch had snuck in and had taken the coat{a} of Joseph, for he was thought to be a beggar and mercy was given him;
[a] See Tunic

18. And he folded it up in a cloth and gave it unto the servant of Chanoch.

19. And he came unto the servant, saying: We shall deliver back into Joseph this tunic that he shall believe all to be well with the house of his father and the house of my father; for surely El Elyon has ordained it so.

20. And the servant of Chanoch said: Surely my lord, I shall do it.

21. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph rejoiced that his coat of many colors was returned unto him,

22. And, thinking his father knew that he was alive, he said: O mother, mother, didst thou offer my petition unto YHVH? (For his mother was no longer alive upon the earth).

23. Didst thou take pity on me, she that bore me?

24. Arise, and come forth from the throne of YHVH, yea come forth and see thy son that hath been sold into slavery, for thou hath taken pity upon me.

25. Arise, see thy son, and weep not over my misfortune; for YHVH observes me and hath set me apart from my brethren.

26. Arise, and accuse not my brethren before El Elyon, but see that YHVH hath justified this thing, and it is my path, and I shall stand with YHVH for all the days of my life.

27. And the servant of Chanoch was amazed and said: Surely this is true, and El Elyon is with him, and if YHVH be with him, then with my master also.

chapter-aka: Joseph in Egypt

1. And it came to pass that the Midianites sold Joseph into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard;

2. And thus we see the Word of YHVH{a} must be heard, for it was even as the father of Joseph saw{b} in a vision, that Joseph should be taken and placed in a land of idolatry.
[a] See Word
[b] See 2 Moses 2:5

3. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH{a} was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.
[a] See YHVH

4. And Joseph found grace in the site of Potiphar, for he did see that Joseph had become a stout man and full of knowledge{a} and wisdom{b}.
[a] Knowledge can represent God the Father
[b] Wisdom can represent God the Mother

5. And so it was that Potiphar made Joseph the overseer{a} over his whole house, and all that Potiphar had he put into the hand of Joseph; and Joseph served Potiphar well.
[a] Or "deputy"

6. And YHVH did greatly bless the house of Potiphar on account of Joseph, and his master saw that YHVH was with him and that YHVH made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

7. ¶ And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, that YHVH blessed the house of the Egyptian for the sake of Joseph; and the blessing of YHVH was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.

8. And it came to pass that Potiphar did leave all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not what he had, save the bread which he did eat.

9. And it came to pass that Joseph was a goodly person and well favored.

10. ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that the wife of the master of Joseph did cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said: Lie with me.

11. But Joseph refused her and said unto the wife of his master: I shall surely not lie with thee, for I have made an oath unto thy husband; who art thou to tempt YHVH?

12. Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;

13. There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife;

14. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against Elohim?

15. ¶ And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her or to be with her.

16. And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.

17. And she caught him by his garment, saying: Lie with me; and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

18. ¶ And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth, that she called unto the men of her house and spoke unto them, saying:

19. See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice;

20. And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.

21. ¶ And it came to pass that she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home;

22. And then it was that she spoke unto him according to these words, saying: The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to caress me;

23. And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me and fled out.

24. ¶ And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying: After this manner did thy servant to me, that his wrath was kindled.

25. And it came to pass that Potiphar commanded his slaves to seek after Joseph and deliver him up.

26. And when Joseph was delivered unto Potiphar, that he did smite him upon the cheek, saying: I have appointed thee to be the master over my whole house;

27. Yea, and there is but only I alone over you: Why therefore hath thou dealt with me in this manner, to bring shame upon my house?

28. And Joseph spoke not, that he not lay shame upon the house of his master by shaming the wife of his master.

29. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph's master took him and put him into prison, a place where the prisoners of the king were bound; and he was there in the prison.

30. But YHVH was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

31. And the keeper of the prison committed in to the hands of Joseph all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the overseer{a} of it.
[a] Or "officer"

32. And it came to pass that the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under Joseph’s hand because YHVH was with him;

33. And that which Joseph did, YHVH made it to prosper.

chapter-aka: Joseph in Prison

1. Now, until the time in which he was taken, Joseph had studied the Torah{a} and all the ways of YHVH{b},
[a] Hebrew, "Teachings," "Law," or "Instructions"
[b] See YHVH

2. And so it was that he had become so learned that he could impart to his brethren all that he had heard from their father, Jacob and his mother, Rachel.

3. And it came to pass that he did not stop studying when he was taken, but he was also learned in Egypt that he might give good counsel in the ways of YHVH in the language of the Egyptians.

4. And it came to pass that because of this he had become the favorite of the sons of Elohim{a} among these, the sons of man{b};
[a] Those that belong to the Church of Christ
[b] Those that do not belong to the Church of Christ; Gentiles

5. And it was because of this that the handmaids who come to serve the guards would kiss and embrace him, and he had been given charge over all of the other prisoners.

6. And it was even as the angel of YHVH{a} had said, for wherever Joseph went, there was he blessed and favored.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

7. ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that the chief cupbearer of the Pharaoh and his cook had offended their lord, who was the king of Egypt.

8. And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, yea even against the chief of his cupbearers and against the chief of his cooks.

9. And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was kept.

10. And the chief guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and it came to pass that they were kept there for a few days’ time.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that both the cupbearer and the cook came to dream a dream, both of them; the cupbearer and the cook of the Pharaoh, which were bound in the prison.

12. And each man found{a} his dream in the same night, each man understood not the meaning or the interpretation of his dream.
[a] Or "remembered"

13. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them; and behold, they were distraught.

14. And Joseph asked the officers of Pharaoh that were with him in the ward of his the house of his master, saying: Wherefore look ye so sadly today?

15. And they said unto him: We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter{a} of it.
[a] Or "that no one can understand"

16. And Joseph said unto them: Do not interpretations belong to Ha'Elohim{a}? Tell me then, thy dreams, I pray you.
[a] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

17. ¶ And the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him: In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

18. And in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes;

19. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into the cup of Pharaoh, and I gave the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.

20. ¶ And Joseph said unto him: This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days;

21. Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place;

22. And thou shalt deliver the cup of Pharaoh into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his cupbearer.

23. But think on me when it shall be well with thee and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me; and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;

24. For indeed I have come willingly out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

25. ¶ And when the chief cook saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph: I also was in my dream; and behold, I had three white baskets on my head;

26. And in the uppermost basket there was all manner of baked goods for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.

27. And Joseph answered and said: This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days;

28. Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang{a} thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
[a] Literally "string up" or "tie up"

29. ¶ And it came to pass the third day, which was birthday of Pharaoh, that he made a feast unto all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and of the chief cook among his servants.

30. And he restored the chief cupbearer unto his position again; and he gave the cup into the hand of Pharaoh;

31. But he hanged the chief cook, as Joseph had interpreted to them.

32. ¶ And it came to pass that the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him; and so it was that Joseph staid awhile longer in that prison.

chapter-aka: The Dreams of Pharaoh

1. And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed a dream; and behold, he stood by the Nile.

2. And behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored cows that were of fatted flesh; and they fed among the reeds.

3. And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by these first seven cows upon the bank of the Nile.

4. And the ill-favored and leanfleshed cows did eat up the seven well-favored and fat cows; and Pharaoh awoke from his dream.

5. ¶ And it came to pass that Pharaoh slept and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up upon one stalk, fattened and ripe and good.

6. And behold, seven thin heads blasted with the heat of the East{a} wind sprung up after them.
[a] East can represent God the Father, knowledge; the East wind is Yesod, Hebrew for "Foundation," the ninth Sefirot, the light of God from Keter shines into the world through our action

7. And the seven thin heads devoured the seven ripe and full heads; and Pharaoh again awoke, and he beheld that it was a dream.

8. ¶ And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit{a} was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians{b} of Egypt and all the wise men{c} thereof;
[a] Or "his heart;" see Heart
[b] Those possessing secret (occult) knowledge; diviners or astrologers; practitioners of priestcraft
[c] A class of learned men, likely including astrologers and magicians

9. And Pharaoh told them his dreams; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that the chief cupbearer spoke unto Pharaoh, saying: I do remember my faults{a} this day;
[a] See 1 Moses 6:7-32

11. Pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the chief guard's house, both me and thy chief baker;

12. And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation{a} of his dream.
[a] Or "meaning," stating that both dreams meant something different

13. And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams, to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

14. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and as to the cook, he was strung up.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that after this Pharaoh sought to discover this Hebrew and sent his men about to learn what could be made known of him.

16. ¶ And it came to pass that when Pharaoh was apprised of him, he sent and called for Joseph.

17. And the servants of Pharaoh brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved{a} himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
[a] To the ancient Egyptians, hairstyles age, gender and class as appearance determined and reflected dignity, status, and political significance

18. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: Why didst thou pretend that thou wast a slave?

19. And Joseph looked at Pharaoh in wonder, but said nothing.

20. Then came Pharaoh again, saying: We have seen that thou art the son of a powerful man in Canaan, and thy father mourns for thee in sackcloth.

21. And Joseph saw that he had been lied to by the son of Chanoch and his servant, and that his father knew not that his son was yet alive.

22. And Joseph was sorry in his heart{a} for his the sake of his father, but he kept this in his heart, and he said unto Pharaoh that he was a slave, and that he had left the house of his father willingly.
[a] See Heart

23. Then Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying: Thou are renown in all of Egypt as an interpreter of dreams, and that thy Elohim{a} art with thee.
[a] Hebrew, "gods," here showing that Pharaoh does not know YHVH; see Elohim

24. And Joseph said: Thou doth speak highly of me, and I am but a slave, yet YHVH{a} is with me, and tell me therefore thy dream that I might make known unto my master, O Pharaoh, the meaning thereof.
[a] See YHVH

25. And Pharaoh looked at Joseph, knowing not what to think, but he spoke unto him saying: I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it:

26. And I have heard it said of thee that thou canst understand this dream to interpret it?

27. And thus Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying: It is not in me; for truly, I am but dust and ashes, and there is no wisdom in me;

28. Yet the very breath{a} of YHVH, El Elyon{b} who is with me can tell thee the meaning thereof; therefore, Elohim shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
[a] Hebrew, "the Most Hight God;"
[b] see El Elyon

29. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river;

30. And behold, there came up out of the river seven fattened and well-favored cows; and they fed in a meadow of reeds;

31. And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for their sickliness;

32. And the lean and the ill-favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows;

33. And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning; and I awoke.

34. And when I slept again, I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain did come up in one stalk, full and good;

35. And behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and blasted with the heat of the east wind, sprang up after them;

36. And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads; and I told this unto the magicians{a}, but there was none that could declare it to me.
[a] Or "astrologers"

37. ¶ And Joseph paused and listened for the breath of YHVH{a} within him, and then Joseph said unto Pharaoh: Both of these dreams of Pharaoh is one dream; Ha’Elohim{b} hath showed Pharaoh what shall come to pass.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

38. The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good heads are seven years; the dream is one.

39. And the seven thin and ill-favored heads of grain that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the heat of the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

40. This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What Ha’Elohim is about to do, and Pharaoh hath been warned that he might save{a} his people.
[a] It was believed that the gods spoke to kings to help them or their kingdoms, and the Egyptians saw Pharaoh as a god

41. Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt;

42. And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land.

43. And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

44. And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because this thing is established by Ha’Elohim, and Ha’Elohim will shortly bring it to pass.

45. ¶ Now, therefore, let Pharaoh look out a man, discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

46. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.

47. And let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up grains aplenty under the hand of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities.

48. And that food shall be for a storage to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land perish not through the famine.

49. And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.

chapter-aka: The Mother of Two Nations

1. And it came to pass that Pharaoh gathered his servants, and told them all that Joseph had said,

2. And speaking unto them, Pharaoh said: Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the Spirit of God{a} is?
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

3. And the servants of Pharaoh murmured amongst themselves saying: What manner of man is this that shall lay his neck out, for if he should fail at his task surely Pharaoh shall put him to death.

4. And, thinking themselves wiser than YHVH Elohim{a}, these, the servants of Pharaoh, spoke unto Pharaoh saying: Surely this man Joseph, he who could tell thee thy dream when all the magicians{b} and wisemen{c} in Egypt could not, surely he should do it.
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] Those possessing secret (occult) knowledge; diviners or astrologers; practitioners of priestcraft
[c] A class of learned men, likely including astrologers and magicians

5. And Pharaoh saw through their fears but also saw the wisdom in this thing; therefore, he did call again for Joseph.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that when Joseph came before Pharaoh that he spoke unto Joseph, saying: Forasmuch as Ha’Elohim{a} hath showed thee all this, there is none as discerning and wise as thou art.
[a] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim

7. Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

8. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: Observe, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.

9. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon the hand of Joseph, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;

10. And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, saying: Bow the knee! and Pharaoh made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.

11. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

12. ¶ And Pharaoh called the name of Joseph Zaphnath-paaneah{a}; and he gave him to wife Asenath{b}, the daughter of Poti-pherah, priest of On.
[a] This name may be Egyptian, but there is no known translation; some Egyptologists believe the second part of the name may contain the word ˁnḫ, "life," Targum Onkelos claimed the name meant "the man to whom mysteries are revealed" or "one who reveals mysteries," Saint Jerome gave the Latin translation "salvator mundi," "savior of the world"
[b] Ancient Egyptian, "she belongs to Neith," Neith was an Egyptian goddess; in the Hebrew, "she belong to her father;"

13. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt, and none of the women of Egypt were as beautiful as the mothers of Joseph; Rachel, Rebecca, and Sarah, except Asenath.

14. Yea, and the sons of the princes and the sons of the kings, also, all young and mighty men did desire her,

15. And there was great strife among them because of her; and even the firstborn son of Pharaoh did desire her;

16. But Asenath set these at naught and scorned every man, she being boastful and haughty.

17. ¶ And it came to pass that she despised her husband, Joseph, at the first, for being a slave and a foreigner, she did see him as being beneath her, for she knew not YHVH{a}.
[a] See YHVH

18. ¶ And it came to pass that Pharaoh did give unto her (and unto her father) many precious things, even jewelry and fine linins;

19. Therefore, she did say: Blessed by my husband, first among the servants of Pharaoh and second only to Pharaoh in all the land;

20. But in her heart, she did not love her husband, but her love was for the precious things, and the maidens and the servants that she had been given.

21. And she wept and hid herself from her husband that she might know him not, for though Joseph was handsome, she desired not to be the mother of slaves.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that after many days, she did concede to lay with her husband, for she was the daughter of an Egyptian priest and had been taught to see wisdom;

23. And she did perceive the wisdom from Ha’Elohim{a} in her husband and came to desire to know of YHVH.
[a] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim

24. And behold, her husband, Joseph, did teach her to petition YHVH Elohim, and she did pray, for she did see that YHVH Elohim{a} was El Elyon{b}, the Most High God, even before the elohim{c} of the Egyptians.
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon
[c] See Elohim of man

25. ¶ And it came to pass that in the house of Joseph was an altar unto YHVH, like unto that which Jacob, the father of Joseph, had made{a};
[a] See 1 Moses 47:11; this could also be a home altar previously unmentioned

26. And there Asenath did pour water in libation upon the altar and prayed her petition unto YHVH.

27. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{a} did come to her, saying: Behold thy husband, Joseph, he is a prince of Egypt;
[a] See Angel of YHVH

28. For his mother, Sarah, was wife to Pharaoh in her day, and El Elyon hath sent this, her son, back into this land that he might offer salvation unto the house of Egypt and unto the house of Israel.

29. Thy husband, Joseph, is a chosen vessel from among the children of men and a great blessing unto all the earth;

30. And from thee shall come two great and mighty nations in the hand of YHVH:

31. And behold, thou shalt be the mother of two mighty nations; therefore raise these, the seed of thy husband, in righteousness unto YHVH, the Elohim of thy husband, and now the Elohim of you:

32. For YHVH exalts whom He will, and YHVH abases whom He will, and who can stay his mighty hand?

33. Therefore, I say unto thee: Thou shalt name the first Manasseh and the second Ephraim, and these shall be fruitful and grow as vines throughout the whole earth.

34. And YHVH seeth all these things that He may richly reward the faithful; for YHVH delights in the righteousness of His children, that He may prosper them with all blessings;

35. Therefore, walk thou humbly before thy Elohim, and in haughtiness{a} no longer; for YHVH has ordained thy husband to be a savior in the land of Egypt,
[a] See 2 Moses 8:16

36. And thy people shall bare him on their shoulders and call him blessed; moreover, thou shall preserve thy house and the holy wisdom of YHVH from destruction.

37. And when many days have passed, thy seed shall be cause for a great work of YHVH in the sight of the infidel unto the glory of YHVH{a}.
[a] Glory of YHVH refers to the presence of God, the Holy Spirit and the Shekinah, and not honor, wealth or status; see Glory of God

38. ¶ And I say unto thee: Even as thy husband hath suffered, thou shalt live in abundance and prosperity all of thy days; therefore, partake of this honeycomb{a} and live.
[a] In the ancient world honeycomb was a symbol of prosperity; eating of the honeycomb and drinking the honey may also be symbolic of the Sacrament of Communion

39. And after she had eaten and drunk of the honeycomb, the angel of YHVH spoke again unto her, saying:

40. Thou hast eaten of the bread of life{a} and drunken from the cup of immortality{b}; and thou hast been anointed before thou wast born to be a High Priestess to act in the name of YHVH;
[a] Bread represents the Torah; bread nourishes the body as the Torah nourishes the soul
[b] The cup represents the feminine aspect of God, the liquid in the cup symbolizes the sacrifice of Jesus' blood for mankind; by drinking from the cup we accept Jesus' sacrifice

41. Therefore, go unto thy husband and ask of him to teach thee all that he knowth of YHVH and to impart upon thee the wisdom of his coat of many colors{a}, for woven into it are the secret mysteries of YHVH.
[a] See Coat of many colors

42. ¶ And it came to pass that when her husband did return unto his household, that she did speak these things unto him, and he did rejoice, and did make and offering unto YHVH.

43. And it came to pass that Joseph did impart unto his wife, Asenath, all that he knew of YHVH Elohim,

44. And Joseph did bless and ordain his wife a High Priestess unto El Elyon{a}, the Most High God, even as Melchizedek{b} had his mother, Sarah, and he did give unto her all the signs and tokens{c}; and YHVH did place a seal upon them.

chapter-aka: Two Nations Born in Famine

1. And it came to pass that when Joseph was thirty years old, he had stood before Pharaoh, who was the king of Egypt;

2. And having gone out from the presence of Pharaoh, Joseph went throughout all the land of Egypt.

3. And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth her fruits by handfuls.

4. And Joseph gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.

5. And Joseph gathered grains as the sands of the sea, and behold, it was so numerous that he left numbering; for it was without number.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph knew his wife, Aseneth, and she conceived, and unto them were born two sons, as the years of famine were about to come in.

7. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said Joseph, hath made me forget all my toil and all the house of my father.

8. And the name of the second Joseph called Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

9. And this was done even as the angel of YHVH{a} had said unto Aseneth, according to the word of YHVH{b}.
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] See YHVH

10. ¶ And Aseneth lifted up her voice in petition to YHVH, saying: YHVH, El Elyon{a} who didst create all things, and didst call them from darkness into light, and from error{b} into truth, and from death into life;
[a] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon
[b] Or "defect," or "blemish;" "sin"

11. Yea, El Elyon that created the heavens above, and the earth we stand upon, and the waters of the deep; O YHVH, hear my supplication:

12. Yea, unto thee, YHVH, I present my supplication, for thou, O YHVH, didst stretch forth thy hands over me, even as a Father that loves his children in their pity and ignorance,

13. And thou hast grown as a tree within me, for the sake of thy Wisdom{a}, and because of this have I abandoned the elohim{b} of my fathers and destroyed their likeness;
[a] See Shekinah
[b] See Elohim of man

14. For thou, O YHVH, hath delivered me from their hands, and rescued me from that serpent{a} that sought to rip at me, cast me into the abyss, into the deepest depths of the Nile:
[a] Egyptian, "Aapep," an ancient chaos deity

15. But I have been swallowed up in the arms of my Mother{a}, and thou, O YHVH hath me when the father and mother of my flesh didst deny me;
[a] See Shekinah

16. For I have left behind their elohim{a} for Thee, and I have no other hope save in Thee, O YHVH;
[a] Hebrew, "gods;" see Elohim of man

17. Therefore, YHVH, renew my flesh, give me power by thy breath{a}, that I should raise these, my sons, unto thee, O YHVH;
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

18. That they too might eat of the bread of life, and drink the cup of thy blessing, which thou has prepared for thine elect.

19. ¶ And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{a} appeared to Joseph in a dream saying: Thy sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, these shall be two mighty nations before YHVH.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

20. And they shall be as two stiff-necked and rebellious goats which run away when they hear the voice of the shepherd.

21. And it shall come to pass that in the latter days they shall be a scourge and a terror and shall fight YHVH when He comes to reward{a} the sons of men.
[a] See Psalm 34:21; Isaiah 3:11, 59:18; Alma 19:66-74, RAV 41:3-10b OPV; Revelation 22:12; Mormon 2:6 RAV, 4:5 OPV

22. However, a remnant shall be faithful unto YHVH; and El Elyon{a} shall give them the earth as an inheritance{b} with thee after I have raised{c} up thy bones from the dust.
[a] See El Elyon
[b] See Matthew 5:5; 3 Nephi 5:52 RAV, 12:5 OPV
[c] See Resurrection

23. ¶ And it came to pass not many days after this, that YHVH spoke again unto Joseph saying: Behold, the famine which shall overtake the land is at hand;

24. And when the famine has become a sore burden on thy kindred, thy brothers shall appear unto you:

25. Be merciful unto them, even as I have been merciful unto thee, and all shall be well with thee and the house of thy master.

26. ¶ And it came to pass that the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt were ended.

27. And the seven years of famine began to come according to the dreams{a} given Pharaoh of Ha’Elohim{b}, even as Joseph had said;
[a] See 2 Moses 7:1-7
[b] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim 

28. And the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

29. And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians: Go unto Joseph; whatever he saith to you, do.

30. ¶ And it came to pass that the adversary{a} came unto Joseph tempting him to say unto the Egyptians: Behold! If thou wilt but give up your allegiance unto deceitful idols{b};
[a] See Satan
[b] Literally "making of by hands;" see Elohim of man

31. And if ye shall say: Blessed is YHVH who giveth bread unto all flesh, then shall I give thee bread;

32. But the breath{a} of YHVH was upon Joseph, and he knew they should refuse to deny their elohim{b}.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] see Elohim of man

33. And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and thus it was that Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the Egyptians;

34. And the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt; therefore, Joseph let go his arrogance, and gave unto all they that came in need to buy grains;

35. And Joseph was blessed, and the people of Egypt were blessed.

36. And the Egyptians, being well fed in the famine, did go about saying: Surely ha’elohim{a} hath brought a Messiah{b} into Egypt, and Pharaoh hath blessed us! For they knew not YHVH Elohim{c}.
[a] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Elohim of man
[b] Hebrew, "Anointed one," "Savior," or "Christ;" see Tzadik Yachad
[c] See YHVH Elohim

37. And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy grain because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

chapter-aka: A Fifth Part for Pharaoh

1. And it came to pass that there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

2. And Joseph had gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into the house of Pharaoh.

3. ¶ And it came to pass that when money ran out in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said: Give us bread; for why should we die in thy presence? For the money is gone!

4. And Joseph said: Bring then unto me your livestock; and I will give you for your livestock, if money fail.

5. And they all brought their livestock unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread for all their livestock for that year.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year and said unto him: We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent;

7. My lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not aught left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands; wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?

8. Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live and not die, that the land be not desolate.

9. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them; and so the land became the land of Pharaoh.

10. And as for the people, he removed{a} them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
[a] Joseph moved everyone to the cities as there was no farming during a famine

11. Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion{a} assigned them of Pharaoh and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore, they sold not their lands.
[a] The priests of Pharaoh were paid for their religious labors, much like the Levies would be

12. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph said unto the people: Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh; lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.

13. And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh; and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.

14. And they said: Thou hast saved our lives; let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be the servants of Pharaoh.

15. ¶ And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which did not belong to Pharaoh.

1. And it came to pass that just as famine did fall upon the land of Egypt, so too did famine fall upon the lands of Jacob.

2. And the sons of Jacob said among themselves: We have little to eat; wherefore shall we suffer ourselves to perish with hunger in this place which has been forsaken by YHVH{a}?
[a] See YHVH

3. And thus did they murmur against YHVH their Elohim{a}.
[a] See Elohim

4. ¶ And it came to pass that when Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons: Why do ye look one upon another?

5. And Jacob said unto his sons: Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; make haste and go down unto Egypt, for there must be a ruler among the Egyptians full of wisdom{a} and knowledge{b} of Ha’Elohim{c}.
[a] Knowledge can represent God the Father
[b] Wisdom can represent God the Mother
[c] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

6. Pray perhaps that he shall have mercy on our souls, and shall sell grain unto you, that we live and not perish.

7. This YHVH hath provided; therefore, get you down thither and buy for us from thence, that we may live and not die.

8. ¶ And it came to pass that ten of the brethren of Joseph went down to buy grain in Egypt;

9. But Benjamin, the younger brother of Joseph, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for Jacob was troubled, least some mischief{a} befall his youngest son.
[a] Or "danger"

10. ¶ And it came to pass that the sons of Jacob came to buy grain among those that came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

11. And Joseph, being the ruler over the land, was he that sold to all the people of the land.

12. ¶ And it came to pass that the brethren of Joseph came and bowed themselves down before him with their faces to the earth.

13. And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them: Whence come ye?

14. And they said: From the land of Canaan to buy food.

15. And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew him not.

16. And Joseph remembered the dreams{a} which he dreamed of them and said unto them: Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
[a] See 2 Moses 2:15-24

17. And they said unto him: Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.

18. We are all the sons of one man; we are true men; thy servants are no spies.

19. And he said unto them: Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye into which ye are come.

20. And they said: Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not{a}.
[a] Or "and one is dead."

21. And Joseph said unto them: That is it that I spoke unto you, saying: Ye are spies;

22. Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

23. Send one of you and let him fetch your brother; and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

24. And he put them all into prison together for three days.

25. ¶ And it came to pass on the third day that Joseph came unto them, saying: This do and live; for I fear Ha’Elohim{a};
[a] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

26. If ye be honest men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison; go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses;

27. But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die.

28. ¶ And it came to pass that they did so.

29. And they said one to another: We are verily guilty concerning our brother, Joseph, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore, is this distress come upon us.

30. And Reuben answered them, saying: Spake{a} I not unto you, saying: Do not sin against the child? And ye would not hear? Therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
[a] See 2 Moses 3:14

31. And they knew not that Joseph understood them, for he spoke unto them by an interpreter.

32. ¶ And Joseph turned himself about from them, and wept, and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

33. Then Joseph commanded his men to fill their sacks with grain, and to restore every man his money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus did he unto them.

34. And they laded their asses with the grain and departed thence.

35. ¶ And it came to pass that as one of them opened his sack to give his ass fodder in the inn, he espied his money; for behold, it was in his the mouth of the sack.

36. And thus he said unto his brethren: My money is restored; and lo, it is even in my sack.

37. And their hearts{a} failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another: What is this that Ha’Elohim hath done unto us?
[a] In the ancient world the heart was understood to be the inner part referring to one’s will, mind, consciousness, emotions and understanding; one’s moral character and determination; the place of knowledge, memory and reflection

1. And it came to pass that they came unto Jacob, their father, unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them, saying: The man, Zaphnath-paaneah, who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us for spies of the country.

2. And we said unto him: We are true men; we are no spies; we be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not{a}, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
[a] Or "and one is dead."

3. And Zaphnath-paaneah, the lord of the country, said unto us: Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone;

4. And bring your youngest brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men; so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.

5. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, the bundle of money of every man was in his sack; and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

6. ¶ And Jacob, their father, said unto them: Ye hath bereaved of my sons! Joseph is not{a}, and Simeon{b} is not, and ye will take Benjamin away; all these things are against me!
[a] See 2 Moses 3:23-30
[b] See 2 Moses 11:26 

7. And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying: Slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

8. And Jacob said: My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone;

9. If mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that the famine was sore in all the lands, and when the house of Jacob had eaten up the grains which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them: Go again; buy us a little food.

11. And Judah spoke unto him, saying: The man did solemnly protest{a} unto us, saying: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you;
[a] See 2 Moses 11:26-27

12. Therefore, if thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food;

13. But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

14. ¶ And Jacob said: Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?

15. And they said: The man, Zaphnath-paaneah, asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred, saying: Is your father yet alive? Have ye another brother?

16. And we told him according to the tenor of these words; could we certainly know that he would say: Bring your brother down?

17. ¶ And Judah said unto Jacob, his father: Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die—both we, and thou, and also our little ones.

18. I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame forever;

19. For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.

20. ¶ And their father, Jacob, said unto them: If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present—a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds;

21. And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight.

22. Take also your brother and arise; go again unto the man; and Elohim Shaddai{a} give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin.
[a] Hebrew, "the Almighty God(s);" see Elohim Shaddai

23. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.

24. ¶ And it came to pass that the men took that present; and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin, and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

25. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house: Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.

26. And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into the house of Joseph.

27. ¶ And the men were afraid because they were brought into the house of Joseph;

28. And the sons of Jacob said: Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in, that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

29. And they came near to the steward of the house of Joseph, and they communed with him at the door of the house, and said: O sir, we came, indeed, down at the first time to buy food;

30. And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks; and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it again in our hand.

31. And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food; we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

32. ¶ And the servant of Joseph said: Peace be to you; fear not; your Elohim{a}, and the Elohim of thy father, hath given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money, and he brought Simeon out unto them.
[a] Hebrew, "Gods;" see Elohim

33. And the man brought the men into the house of Joseph and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave food to their donkeys.

34. And they made ready the gifts for Joseph to come at noon; for they heard that they should eat bread there.

35. ¶ And it came to pass that when Joseph came home, they brought him the gifts which was in their hand into the house and bowed{a} themselves to him to the earth.
[a] See 2 Moses 2:15-21

36. And he asked them of their welfare and said: Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

37. And they answered: Thy servant, our father, is in good health; he is yet alive; and they bowed down their heads and made to honor Joseph.

38. And Joseph lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, the son of his own mother, and said: Is this your younger brother of whom ye spoke unto me?

39. And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother; and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber and wept there.

40. And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said: Set on bread{a}.
[a] Or "bring out food"

41. And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him by themselves because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination{a} unto the Egyptians.
[a] A detestable act or detestable thing

42. And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright{a} and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marveled one at another.
[a] The brothers were sat by age, something they did not expect the Egyptians to know

43. And Joseph took and sent food unto them from his own table; but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs; and they drank and were merry with him.

1. And it came to pass that the following day Joseph did command the steward of his house, saying: Fill the sacks of them men with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in the mouth{a} his sack,
[a] Or "opening"

2. And put my cup, the silver cup in that I use to see{a}, in the mouth of the youngest man's sack, and there all the money given us for the grain.
[a] Or "interprets omens;" a form of divination, Joseph was a seer of the Lord and may have gained visions from God through the reflections of the cup, or reflections from the liquid in the  cup; it may also have been used for libations to God when requesting visions

3. And the steward of the house of Joseph did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.

4. ¶ And it came to pass that as soon as the morning was light, the men readied themselves for their journey beck unto the house of their father, Jacob.

5. And knowing not that Joseph could speak their tongue, Judah said unto his brethren: Surely this man is mad{a}; therefore, let us go now before he resends his kindness.
[a] Hebrew, shaga; "craziness"

6. And his brothers were all in agreement, all but Benjamin who did feel a longing for this man, knowing not that Joseph too was a son of Rachel; yet he harkened unto his brethren.

7. And Joseph came unto Benjamin, and speaking in the tongue of the Egyptians he placed his hand upon the head of his brother, saying: El Elyon{a}, be gracious unto thee my brother.
[a] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon

8. But the sons of Jacob knew not what Joseph said, yet they thanked him and were sent away, they and their asses.

9. ¶ And when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward: Follow up after these men;

10. And when thou dost overtake them, say unto them: Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

11. Is not this the cup whereby my lord seeth with, and indeed in which he divineth{a}? Ye have done evil in so doing.
[a] Hebrew "nachash;" "to practice divination, or observe signs"

12. ¶ And it came to pass that the steward of Joseph and his men did quickly overtake them, and he spake unto them the very words his master, Joseph, had given him.

13. And the brothers of Joseph said unto the steward: Wherefore saith my lord these words? Far be it that thy servants should do according to this thing.

14. Behold, the money, which we found in the mouths of our sacks, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of the house of thy lord silver or gold?

15. With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen even for the rest of our days.

16. And the steward of the house of Joseph said: Now also let it be even according unto your words; except that he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

17. ¶ Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened them.

18. And the steward of the house of Joseph searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest; and so it was that the cup was found in the sack of Benjamin.

19. And the steward of the house of Joseph spoke again, saying: Thinkest that ye didst know better than my master?

20. For he doeth see all, and he did even know that this famine should come; therefore, think ye that he would not know even this, and that ye should fool him twice?

21. And this he spoke, even as Joseph had instructed; and all the sons of Jacob but Benjamin were afraid, that should they be made slaves, even as they had sold their brother, Joseph;

22. And they murmured that it was even as their father, Jacob, had feared, that Benjamin should fall into some mischief.

23. And they did rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city being overseen by the steward of the house of Joseph and his army;

24. And Benjamin went with them also, yet he was not troubled, for he knew.

chapter-aka: The Revelation of Joseph

1. And it came to pass that Judah and his brethren came to the house of Joseph, for he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground.

2. And Joseph said unto them: What deed is this that ye have done? Knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

3. ¶ And Judah said: What shall we say unto my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves?

4. Ha’Elohim{a} hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's servants, both we and he also with whom the cup is found.
[a] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

5. And Joseph said: Far be it that I should do so; but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

6. ¶ Then Judah came near unto him and said: O my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my the ears of my lord, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.

7. My lord asked his servants, saying: Have ye a father or a brother?

8. And we said unto my lord: We have a father, an old man; and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

9. And thou saidst unto thy servants: Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.

10. And we said unto my lord: The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.

11. And thou saidst unto thy servants: Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

12. And it came to pass, when we came up unto thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.

13. And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little food.

14. And we said: We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the face of that man, except our youngest brother be with us.

15. And thy servant, my father, said unto us: Ye know that my wife bare me two sons; and the one went out{a} from me, and I said: Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since;
[a] See 2 Moses 3:23-30

16. And if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

17. Now, therefore, when I come to thy servant, my father, and the lad be not with us, seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life,

18. It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant, our father, with sorrow to the grave.

19. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying: If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.

20. ¶ Now, therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bondman to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren.

21. For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me, lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father?

22. And Joseph said unto him: Yea, and so it shall be that thee and thy seed after shall serve me and my seed for all days until that day in the which I AM{a} shall come unto the earth and free all bond between thy seed and my seed, that all shall be free.
[a] See Ahyeh Asher

23. And so shall it be that in the last days a remnant of thy seed and a remnant of my seed shall be profitable before YHVH{a}.
[a] See YHVH Ahyeh

24. ¶ And the brothers of Joseph marveled, for these words he spoke in their own tongue and not through the interpreter;

25. And Judah spoke again, saying: What manner is this? And they saw that Joseph knew all that they had said from the beginning.

26. ¶ And so it was that Joseph could not refrain himself any longer before they that stood by him; and Joseph commanded with a loud voice: Cause every man to go out from me.

27. And so it was that Joseph was alone there in the room, and he made himself known unto his brethren; and so great were his tears that even the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

28. And his brethren were afraid, for they understood not and thought this man possessed by an evil spirit{a}.
[a] Hebrew, ruaḥ tum'ah, an "unclean spirit;" a dybbuk

29. ¶ And after some time had passed, Joseph spoke unto his brethren, saying: I am Joseph. Doth my father yet live?

30. And his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence.

31. And Joseph said unto his brethren: Come near to me, I pray you; and they came near.

32. And he said: See that it is I, and that I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold;

33. Now, therefore, be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither; for Elohim{a} did send me before you to preserve life:
[a] See Elohim

34. For these two years hath the famine been in the land; and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be plowing nor harvest.

35. And even as I did dream the dream that ye should bow before me, so did Elohim send me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

36. So now it was not you that sent me hither, but Ha’Elohim{a}; and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

37. ¶ Now make haste, and go up to our father, and say unto him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: Ha'Elohim hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me; tarry not;

38. And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast;

39. And there will I nourish thee, for yet there are five years of famine, lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast come to poverty.

40. ¶ And still the elder brothers of Joseph, they that had sold him, knew not what to think, and they stood astonished.

41. And seeing this, Joseph spoke again unto them, saying: Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you!

42. And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

43. And he fell upon the neck of his brother, Benjamin, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.

44. And seeing that it was Joseph, their brother, and that he bore no malice towards them, they rejoiced;

45. And Joseph kissed all his brethren and wept upon them; and after that, his brethren made arrangements with him.

46. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph sent his brethren back unto the house of Jacob, their father, and they departed; and he said unto them: See that ye fall not out by the way.

chapter-aka: The Vision of Joseph and Asenath

1. And it came to pass that after the sons of Jacob had left their brother Joseph, that Joseph and his wife, Asenath, did make and offering before YHVH{a} at the altar of YHVH there in the house of Joseph.
[a] See YHVH

2. And as the fire was burning the offering that they should eat it, the angel of YHVH{a} appeared unto them, even standing in the fire.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

3. And Joseph cried out, thinking that he should die, even as he would be reunited with his father;

4. But the angel of YHVH spoke unto him, saying: Fear not, for thou hast been chosen from all thy brethren, and even from all the sons of man which dwell here upon the earth;

5. For through thy seed shall all nations be blessed with the fruit of the earth, and the wine shall even overflow, and the milk shall run off and spoil for that vastness of it.

6. ¶ And Joseph and Asenath did bow; but the angel of YHVH said: Arise and lift up thy eyes; behold the handiwork of YHVH!

7. And the eyes of Joseph and Asenath were opened unto the vision of YHVH, and they did see many great and marvelous things.

8. And Joseph said: What is the meaning of this? It is great to behold and marvelous in my eyes!

9. ¶ And the angel of YHVH said unto them: These are lands upon which thy seed shall dwell;

10. For the land upon which thou dwelleth, and the land which the famine is upon is but one part of the creation that is the earth.

11. And behold, ye see that there are lands without number, stars without number, and worlds without number{a};
[a] See 1 Moses 2:11

12. And this is the work and glory of Ha’Elohim{a}: To grant unto the very children of Elohim{b} all that which was theirs from the beginning; yea, even all that YHVH Elohim{c} doth possess.

[b] Or "Children of Christ," Christians; see Children of Elohim

14. And Joseph and Asenath fell down and worshiped YHVH.

15. ¶ And the angel of YHVH spoke again, saying: Joseph and Asenath, if ye art faithful to YHVH all the days of thy life, and should walk in circumcision before My Face{a}, ye shall be lifted up, even to the throne of Ha’Elohim, and made master workers of all wisdom, yea, even in the hidden wisdom of YHVH.
[a] See Shekinah

16. And together ye shall inherit the glory of YHVH, even all thy seed that shall remain faithful;

17. And in this ye shall find great joy, for YHVH delights to give his children the works of His hands.

18. And sitting upon the throne of Ha’Elohim, ye shall be the very sons and daughters of Elohim, even as thy fathers and mothers, Abraham and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah;

19. And YHVH Elohim shall be thy Father, forever and ever, for YHVH casts the proud to the dust and exalts the humble.

20. And in the last days, the power of the wicked shall be completely destroyed by the faith of a remnant of thy seed, for YHVH delights in the throne of the faithful.

21. ¶ And the angel of YHVH said: Look!

22. And when Joseph and Asenath had looked up, they beheld a great multitude which had the appearance of the Son of man{a};
[a] See Son of man

23. And they beheld that these did shine like the sun, and everyone of them had a crown of gold upon their heads; and these were singing and praising YHVH around His glorious throne.

24. And there was one in the midst of the throne which had his name written on him, which was Haniel{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "Joy of God" or "Grace of God;" One of the seven archangels, Moses in the flesh; see Zenos 8, Haniel

25. And the angel of YHVH said unto Joseph and Asenath: Thus sayeth YHVH Elohim: Joseph, my son, Asenath, my daughter; these are they who glorify my name; and they shall be my sons and daughters forever.

26. And when thy seed and all the seed of Jacob shall be laid low in this land, Haniel shall come in the flesh to deliver all of the seed of Jacob, even all they that shall believe in YHVH;

27. And his name shall be Moses, for he shall draw my people from out of this land, even by my mercy shall he do this thing;

28. And he shall be the Tzadik Yachad{a} of that generation and shall declare my Torah{b} and make Israel once again my covenant peoples.
[a] See Tzadik Yachad
[b] Hebrew, "Teachings" "Instructions," or "Law"

29. ¶ And they looked again, and saw another in the midst of them and beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noon-day,

30. And he carried with Him the breath{a} of life, giving this light unto all they that should partake;
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

31. And they saw that the seed of Israel would spit on him, and curse him, and did hang him from a tree that he died:

32. And they saw too that this one was Yachad Yachid Echad{a}, even the very Anointed One{b}; the Messiah{b}.
[a] See Yachad Yachid Echad
[b] Messiah: "Anointed one,""Savior," or "Christ"

33. And the angel of YHVH spoke unto them, saying: And when he shall rise up on the third day, ye too shall rise from the dust and take up your inheritance with thy fathers and the mothers forever.

34. ¶ And the angel of YHVH said: Look!

35. And Joseph and Asenath looked again, and they beheld another one in the midst of the throne which had his name written on him, which was Ariel{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "lion of God;" see Ariel

36. And the angel of YHVH said unto Joseph and Asenath: Behold the descendant of thy seed;

37. And in the last days he shall be born in the flesh, and shall be the Tzadik Yachad of that generation:

38. And he shall be a restorer of the things of YHVH and shall begin the task of that generation to make all as at first and to make ready the coming of YHVH for the second{a} time.

chapter-aka: The Vision of Jacob

1. And it came to pass that after the brothers of Joseph went up out of Egypt that they did come into the land of Canaan unto Jacob, their father,

2. And these sons of Jacob spoke unto him, saying: Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.

3. And Jacob's heart{a} fainted, and he believed them not.
[a] Referring to one’s will, mind, consciousness, understanding and emotions; see Heart

4. ¶ And Judah and Levi took him out of the house, saying: Behold, the fame thereof was heard even unto the house of Pharaoh, saying: the brethren of Joseph are come!

5. And it pleased Pharaoh well, he and his servants.

6. And Pharaoh said unto thy son Joseph: Say unto thy brethren: This do ye: Lade your beasts and go; get you unto the land of Canaan; and take your father and your households and come unto me;

7. And I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land; there for see that we art commanded.

8. And this we shall do: take our wagons to get our little ones, and our wives, and all of our households, and bring thee and thy household, and come unto Egypt and live.

9. ¶ And these words did Pharaoh say unto us: Regard not that which ye have; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.

10. And thus, we have returned unto thee, according to the commandment of Pharaoh; and look and see that thy son Joseph gave us provision for the way.

11. And behold, to all of us he gave each man changes of clothing; but to thy son Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels and five changes of clothing.

12. And see that unto thee, thy son Joseph hath sent thee after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt and ten she asses laden with corn, and bread, and meat for thee, his father, by the way.

13. ¶ And after they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto them; and he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, was revived.

14. And Jacob said: It is enough; Joseph, my son, is yet alive; I will go and see him before I die.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the Elohim{a} of his father Isaac.
[a] Hebrew, "Gods;" see Elohim

16. And there YHVH{a} spoke unto Jacob in the visions of the night and said: Jacob, Jacob!
[a] See YHVH

17. And Jacob said: Here am I.

18. And he said, I am Ha’El{a}, the Elohim of thy father; and thou, Jacob, art Israel, for this new name did I give unto thee.
[a] Hebrew, "The God"

19. And I say unto thee: Fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation.

20. And I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Joseph’s own hands shall rest thy eyes.

21. My mercy is upon thee, and upon thy seed and all thy household, but after a time the Egyptians shall worry{a} of thy seed, and these shall begin to forget me;
[a] See 3 Moses 1:11-13

22. And they shall see Lilith{a} and Cain{b} as nonsense and begin to wonder off after works made by the hands of men in the flesh.
[a] Hebrew, "of the night;" see Lilith
[b] Lilith and Cain here represent selfish desires

23. But have faith, for thy seed shall be made free, and I shall send thy son, Levi, to free them; and like thy son Joseph he shall be a prince, but then he shall fall only to rise again a king.

24. ¶ Therefor I say: Go thee unto Egypt and fear not, for though evil doth lurk there so too doth life, and thy seed must live among the Egyptians that they might live{a};
[a] Or "survive"

25. And thy seed must live that all the world might see my face{a} and live:
[a] s a pun of sorts, another way of saying "the Glory of God be upon them"

26. For in thy seed shall they be made free, by the hand of thy son Judah, in who’s line shall I be born unto the world and make the clay of my creation my flesh;

27. Therefore, again I say unto thee: Get thee and thy house unto Egypt and fear not, for I am with thee.

28. Yeah, get thee and thy house unto Egypt that thy seed shall live, this is my will, and my works shall be done, and my Word shall be harkened unto and obeyed.

29. ¶ And it came to pass that when Jacob heard this, he arose and took those of his house and went on their way.

1. And it came to pass that Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba{a}; and the sons of Jacob carried Jacob, their father, and their little ones, and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry them.
[a] Hebrew, "well of seven"

2. And they took their cattle and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him:

3. His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

13. And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli;

14. And the sons of Asher: Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah, their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.

15. These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

16. The sons of Rachel, the wife of Jacob wife: Joseph and Benjamin.

17. And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath, the daughter of Poti-pherah{a}, priest of On, bare unto him.
[a] Egyptian, "he whom the Ra gave;" a priest of the Egyptian god On

18. And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

19. These are the sons of Rachel which were born to Jacob; all the souls were fourteen.

23. All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;

24. And the sons of Joseph, which were borne him in Egypt, were two souls; all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.

25. And they brought with them all of their servants and the children of their servants; and all of these were counted as Israel, and these are not numbered.

26. ¶ And Jacob sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

27. And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.

28. And Jacob said unto Joseph: Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.

chapter-aka: Israel before Pharaoh

1. And it came to pass that Joseph said unto his brethren and unto the house of his father: I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say unto him: My brethren and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

2. And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle{a}; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
[a] A generic term for domesticated animals

3. And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you and shall say: What is your occupation?

4. That ye shall say: Thy servants' trade hath been about livestock from our youth even until now, both we and also our fathers; that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

5. ¶ Then it came to pass that Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said: My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have are come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

6. And it came to pass that he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.

7. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren: What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh: Thy servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers.

8. They said, moreover, unto Pharaoh: For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan.

9. Now, therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

10. ¶ And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying: Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee;

11. The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell:

12. In the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my livestock.

13. ¶ And Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob, being a High Priest unto El Elyon{a}, did bless Pharaoh.
[a] Hebrew, "Most High God;" see El Elyon

14. And Pharaoh said unto Jacob: How old art thou?

15. And Jacob said unto Pharaoh: The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a eighty and seven years; few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

16. And Jacob kneeled before Pharaoh and went out from before Pharaoh.

17. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

18. And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household with bread, according to their wants, according to their families.

19. And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

1. And it came to pass that the time drew nigh that Jacob must die;

2. And he called his son Joseph and said unto him: If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh{a} and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;
[a] A way of making an oath

3. But I will lie with my fathers; and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.

4. And Joseph answered him, saying: I will do as thou hast said.

5. And Jacob said: Swear unto me.

6. And Joseph swore unto him.

7. And Jacob bowed himself upon the bed's head for the relief of it.

8. ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Joseph, saying: Behold, thy father is sick.

9. And Joseph went unto his father, Jacob, and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

10. And these, Manasseh and Ephraim, had Joseph and Asenath raised in the knowledge of YHVH{a}; and they had grown up in the ways and instruction of YHVH Elohim{b};
[a] See YHVH
[b] See YHVH Elohim

11. And behold, they did not deviate from the way which their father and mother taught them, neither to the right nor to the left; and YHVH was with them.

12. ¶ And it came to pass that it was told Jacob: Look, and behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee, he and his sons; and Jacob strengthened himself and sat upon the bed.

13. And Jacob said unto Joseph:Elohim Shaddai{a} appeared unto me at Luz{b} in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
[a] See Elohim Shaddai
[b] See 1 Moses 14:1-14

14. And said unto me: Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, saith YHVH; and I will make of thee a multitude of people, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

15. And now, of thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, behold, they are mine,

16. And the Elohim{a} of my fathers shall bless them; even as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be blessed, for they are mine; wherefore, they shall be called after my name.
[a] See Elohim

17. And it came to pass that after this time were Manasseh and Ephraim called Israel.

18. And thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance in the tribes; therefore, they were called the tribes of Manasseh and of Ephraim.

19. ¶ And Jacob said unto Joseph: When the Elohim of my fathers appeared unto me in Luz in the land of Canaan, he swore unto me that he would give unto me and unto my seed the land for an everlasting possession;

20. Therefore, O my son, El Elyon{a} hath blessed me in raising thee up to be a servant unto me, in saving my house from death,
[a] See El Elyon

21. In delivering my people, thy brethren, from famine which was sore in the land;

22. Wherefore, the Elohim of thy fathers shall bless thee and the fruit of thy loins, that they shall be blessed above thy brethren and above thy father's house;

23. For thou hast prevailed, and the house of thy father hath bowed down unto thee, even as it was shown{a} unto thee before thou wast sold by the hands of thy brethren that thou should be found here, in the land of Egypt.
[a] 2 Moses 2:15-21

24. Wherefore, thy brethren shall bow down unto thee, from generation to generation, unto the fruit of thy loins forever;

25. For thou shalt be a light unto my people, to deliver them in the days of their captivity from bondage and to bring salvation unto them when they are altogether bowed down under sin.

26. And, therefore, as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died{a} by me in the land of Canaan, in the way when we were yet but a little way to come unto Ephrath;
[a] 1 Moses 47:9

27. And I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is called Bethlehem.

28. ¶ And Jacob beheld the sons of Joseph and said: Who are these?

29. And Joseph said unto his father: They are my sons, whom Ha’Elohim{a} hath given me in this land.
[a] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

30. And Jacob said: Bring them, I pray thee, unto me; and I will bless them.

31. Now the eyes of Jacob were dim for age, and from years of weeping bitterly for the loss of his son, Joseph, so that he could not see well;

32. And Joseph brought them near unto him; and Jacob kissed them and embraced them.

33. And Jacob said unto Joseph: I had not thought to see thy face; and lo, Ha’Elohim hath showed me also thy seed.

34. ¶ And it came to pass that when Joseph had brought Manasseh and Ephraim out from before their father, Jacob, Joseph bowed himself with his face to the earth.

35. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand{a} toward the left hand of Jacob, and Manasseh in his left hand toward the right hand of Jacob and brought them near unto him.
[a] Joseph is giving his sons to Jacob to be blessed based on age

36. And Jacob stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing{a} his hands; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
[a] Jacob switches the younger to the greater blessing, as he did to his father

37. And Jacob blessed Joseph and said: Ha’Elohim, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, Ha’Elohim which fed me all my life long unto this day,

38. YHVH, which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

39. ¶ And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he held up his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

40. And Joseph said unto his father: Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

41. And his father, Jacob, refused and said: This I know, my son, I know it; and it shall even be as it was with me and my brother, Esau:

42. Manasseh also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

43. ¶ And Jacob blessed them that day, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, saying: God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.

44. And so it was that Jacob set Ephraim before Manasseh.

45. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob said unto Joseph: Behold, I die; but Elohim shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

46. Moreover, I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

47. And it came to pass that Joseph and his sons took leave of their father, Jacob, and Joseph wept privately, that only his sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, should know.

18. Therefore, take courage and warn thy sons, let them know to remember YHVH always that thy seed might bring forth the final act of creation.

13. And none shall stop them, for this day I have declared that the first shall be the last, and the last shall be the first:

[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] See Ha’Elohim
[c] A type of weapon

2. O that my soul should never come into their secret! Mine honor shall not be united to their assembly!

3. For in their anger, they slew a man, and they killed beasts for pleasure.

4. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their wrath, for it was cruel; and for this, Simeon, thy right hand did wither; yet in thy reproach was it healed.

5. And thus, to protect thy seed, YHVH{a} will divide them and scatter them in Israel;

6. Therefore, thy throne shall be imprisoned by thy brother, Judah, and set to the South{a}, and he shall be thy protection;

11. And thou art as the tower, for thy strength is great, and the sword in the hand of thy seed shall flow with power.

12. And thy seed shall seek violence, being rash; therefore, they shall be held back for a time by thy brethren; yet when they shall be sent forth, they shall be a scourge of justice.

13. ¶ And in the last days, when all ye my sons shall gather in thy strength, thy seed shall be an army and the defender of Israel;

14. And a green{a} banner shall go out before thee and thy seed, and the understanding of YHVH shall be with thy seed in the last days.
[a] In Kabbalah, green represents growth and renewal

15. And they shall make thy boarders and shall serve to protect all they that seek Israel for protection;

16. But these should be not rash, and learn to temper their righteous justice with mercy, for YHVH loveth all the creation;

17. Therefore, remember, thou my son, a sheathed sword and a sharp tongue can win more wars by the bringing of peace:

18. But when peace should not be established, know to strike quickly, that thine enemies might know thy strength and settle in peace for they are overtaken.

19. ¶ And thy daughters shall be taught to carry the shield, and to defend the defenseless, and seek justice for they that findeth not succor;

20. And their tongues shall be as swords, and their words shall carry, and the thunderings of El Elyon{a} shall be heard in their cries;
[a] See El Elyon

21. And their victories shall be swift, and they shall repent of their ways and seek justice for the creation of Elohim.

22. And the proud shall they bring low, and the haughty shall they exhume that the light of the Creator might shine brightly.

23. Wherefore, know thou, my son Simeon, that even as thy hand was withered for a time and then healed, so too shall thy seed be restored in fullness at the last days.

[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

2. Levi, thou used the strength of thy cunning beside thy brother, Simeon; and in this it is even as I said before: the mekerah{a} of you are vessels of malicious violence.
[a] A type of weapon

3. For in your secret assembly, and in your anger, you slew a man, and sought death at thy pleasure;

4. Therefore, thou too shall be cursed by thy anger, and thy fierce wrath, for thy deeds were cruel.

5. But in thy penance thou sought the succor of YHVH{a} and to serve YHVH, and this thy seed shall do:
[a] See YHVH

6. And thus, that thy seed should serve YHVH, YHVH will divide them and scatter them throughout Israel;

[a] The first month on the Hebrew calendar is Abib, today called Nisan; see Nisan

[a] See Doctrines of the Saints 117, 119

15. ¶ But when the veil shall be torn{a}, thy seed shall share in these duties with thy brethren and sistren, yet ye shall teach them that they should know to do so in righteousness.
[a] See Matthew 27:51

16. And thy daughters shall do likewise, and pour out their libations{a} to wash the earth clean, and find joy in the wisdom{b} of Ha’Elohim and serve YHVH in righteousness;

19. ¶ And in the last days, ye shall remember my holy days and teach them to thy brethren,

20. Both thy sons and thy daughters shall work with thy brother, Ephraim, to bring them back to their inheritance;

21. And thy remembrance shall be great, and thy covenants shall be restored to thee, and thou shall teach thy brethren again to remember the law{a} of sacrifice{b}.

23. To prepare the earth, to cleans the earth, and to love all of this, the creation of Elohim.

24. ¶ And Levi, my son, I give unto thee this charge: That thy seed shall not forget thy daughters, nor sell their birthright;

25. For at the last days, wisdom{a} shall be forgotten, but as a whisper upon the lips of the righteous;
[a] Wisdom could be associated with Heavenly Mother

26. Forget not to plant the trees, and pour libations upon the altars, and burn the fire of incense that YHVH may be pleased in thy service.

9. And thy seed shall be valiant in watching over the flocks, that when the wild beasts should come, thou shalt pursue and overtake them.

10. Yet thou art one of action, and so too shall thy seed be, thy sons and thy daughters shall ever be on the lookout and shall not rest until Israel is gathered.

11. ¶ And thy sons shall stand ready and be watchmen over Israel, and thy daughters shall dream dreams and their visions shall surely come to pass;

12. For thy sons shall put their trust in YHVH in that day and make clear the path that all of Israel might be one in YHVH Elohim{a} again.

13. And thy daughters shall be seers and shall find that which has been lost,

[a] Hebrew, "Tsiyyon" or "Tzion," meaning "marking;" see Zion

15. And when the viper should strike, she shall be ready, and shall strike quickly and with deadly force;

1. And filled with the breath{a} of Ha’Elohim{b}, Jacob spoke unto his son Asher, saying:
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] See Ha’Elohim

2. Out of Asher shall come much grains and fat breads, for thou art as the olive tree, and thou shall yield delicacies befitting thy King;

3. Therefore, thy throne shall be set to the East{a}, and the sea shall be as a wall upon thee, for thou art the peace of Israel.
[a] East representing Avinu, God the Father; see Cardinal directions

4. And in the eleventh{a} month, there shall be heavy rains upon the earth that thou shalt find thy strength, and that the earth should be prepared for thee, and thy seed shall be ready;
[a] See Shevat

5. For thy seed shall wear two faces, and they that seek peace shall see the face of war upon thee; and they that see war shall see the face of peace;

6. Therefore, let thy hands be thy strength in Ha’Elohim and thy tongue be thy weapon in YHVH{a} that none might defeat thee.
[a] See YHVH

7. Seek ye after truth, and YHVH shall lead thee, and the breath of Elohim{a} shall be thy breath, and the voice of Ha’Elohim shall be upon thy tongue;
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

8. And in that day, after thou hast been driven North{a}, thy seed shall lay waste to those that should oppress them, and their strength shall be made known.
[a] North representing Shekinah; see Cardinal directions

9. ¶ And at the last day thy sons shall bear the weight of bartering in Israel, that the will of YHVH be known and the justice of Elohim be made whole;

10. For in that day, brother shall turn against brother, sister against sister; father against son, and mother against daughter;

11. So it is that they who shall slay the wicked too shall be wicked and they that slay the just shall also be just; and thy seed shall be their defenders.

12. And thy seed shall be tasked with the treaties of Israel; therefore, thy camp shall ever be to the North, for there doth the wisdom of Elohim preside.

13. ¶ And thy daughters in that day shall be made clean and shall prepare the table for the banquet that Israel might make feasts in the name of YHVH;

14. And they shall pour out their libations{a} upon the altars and serve up the wine to those that shall drink to the reign of the true King;
[a] Hebrew, "to pour;" see Libations

15. And the king of peace{a} shall guide them, and the tower{b} of YHVH shall defend them and be their strength, and thy daughters shall even be as watchmen upon the towers.
[a] See Melchizedek
[b] See Magdalene

16. And thy sons also shall stand watch and make ready that the sons of Levi should come forth from their midst and offer up a sacrifice unto YHVH Elohim in righteousness.

17. ¶ And in that day, thou shall sit with Levi and with Judah and study the words of YHVH to know the teachings of Ha’Elohim;

18. Therefore, my son Asher, cease not thy prayers and thy supplication before YHVH, but seek after the wisdom{a} of Elohim that it should grow in the land as a tree{b} of great strength;
[a] See Shekinah
[b] See 1 Moses 4:16; Melchizedek 2:10; 1 Nephi 3:46-53 RAV, 11:8-13 OPV; Zenos 2:16, 3:40, 9:5-14; Tree of Life

19. And that tree shall be unto thee as a pillar of righteousness before YHVH Elohim{a}, and written upon it shall be the understanding{b} of Ha’Elohim;
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] See Binah

20. For even as the serpent{a} shall wind itself upon thy feet and bruise thy heel, the pillar of El Elyon{b} shall bear down to smash its head, even as thou art knelt in thy supplication;
[a] See Genesis 3:15, 1 Moses 5:32-33
[b] See El Elyon

21. Therefore, carve the name of YHVH into the pillars{a}, and carve the Torah{b} of YHVH into the pillars, and wear these upon thy heart that the justice{c} and mercy{d} of YHVH Elohim be known.

[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] See Ha’Elohim

2. And seeing that his resting place was good, and the land, that it was pleasant, he shall pitch his tent upon the neck of the hill and begin his labors upon the earth;

3. Therefore, his throne shall rest to the North{a}, and be placed between the East{b} and the West{c} that the knowledge and wisdom of Yah{d} and the mercy of YHVH{e} shall guide him.

[a] The fifth month on the Hebrew calendar is Av; see Av

5. For the moon{a} shall shine full and bright for thy daughters, and thy sons shall study the words of YHVH that they might teach all of Israel the will of El Elyon{b};
[a] In modern Judaism, there is a full moon holy day, Tu B'Av, a holy day of love that likely reflects an ancient Mother Goddess that was rejected when Judea became monotheistic
[b] See El Elyon

6. For Issachar is a learned man, and his seed shall too be learned in the ways of the earth,

7. And they shall read the stars and seek after the signs and wonders Ha’Elohim hath written upon them.

8. And thy sons shall know the times, and thy daughters shall raise their children in wisdom and in all cunning things;

9. Therefore, thy camp shall be made to the East, for there doth the knowledge of Elohim{a} dwell, even upon the qafim{b}.
[a] See Elohim
[b] Hebrew, "east wind;" see Exodus 10:13, 14, 21. See also Mosiah 5:50 RAV, 7:31 OPV; 7:55 RAV, 12:6 OPV 2 Moses 7:5; 3 Moses 15:18, 20:23

10. ¶ And in that day that thy seed should be driven North, thy seed shall scatter upon the winds and upon the seas;

11. And thy seed shall be rooted deep within the earth, yet YHVH shall uproot thee that thy seed should be made to spread out.

12. And at that last day, thy daughters shall come in and shall enlighten the sons of man with their knowledge,

13. And thy sons shall go forth and shall teach the daughters of man with their wisdom;

14. Therefore, thy seed shall lift up their heads from out of the earth, and their eyes they shall pull away from the stars that they might teach all of Israel the secrets of YHVH:

15. For Israel is not to be ruled by the heavens, but YHVH shall be their guide,

16. And Ha’Elohim hath written out His decree upon the skies, yet Israel is to bring the will of YHVH to the earth, while all other creation is governed by their{a} decree.
[a] The Gods' decree, as written in the stars

17. ¶ Wherefore, Issachar, teach thy seed to covet not after gold, nor costly apparel, but to wait upon the will of Ha’Elohim and El Elyon, that the spirits of deceit shall have no power over them;

18. Yea, teach thy seed to love the creation even as YHVH loveth His creation, and to have compassion for the lowly, and the poor, and the weak:

19. Issachar, my son, teach thy seed to seek not after slippery things they cannot hold, for this shall lead many to covetousness, fornication, and malice;

20. But teach thy seed the comfort of YHVH Elohim, and to share their bread with the poor, and suckle those in need, and to serve their enemies.

21. And this shall be a hard thing for them, for their eyes shall wonder off after mysteries{a}, but if they will harken unto YHVH their Elohim, great shall be the reward of Israel.

2. Zebulun shall dwell to the West{a} and westward; he shall become a haven for truth resting between the seas, and his border shall be unto Zidon{b};

[b] Or "Sidon," a fishing town named after the grandson of Noah; see 1 Moses 15:12-14, Genesis 10:15-19

[a] North representing Shekinah, God the Mother; see Cardinal directions
[b] East representing Avinu, God the Father; see Cardinal directions

4. And in the fourth{a} month, even at the summer, thy seed shall be planted that thy crops may be gathered, and Israel fed, and that thy calves be made fat, and that their bread be full;
[a] See Tammuz

5. For thou didst weep for thy brother, Joseph and kept Israel’s secret{a} with a troubled heart; therefore, mercy shall be great in thy seed, and the fatted lamb shall be thine to give.
[a] Referring to his brothers selling Joseph; see 2 Moses 3:19-22

6. ¶ And when Israel shall be ready for to flee this land, thy brother, Levi, shall take refuge and should flee unto thy seed,

7. And he shall bless him and take him in as one of his own that he be ready to deliver my children from their bondage.

8. And thy seed shall be united and divided, for they shall be as a watchman over thy brother, Issachar, and shall be blessed by the seed of Issachar even as they shall be a blessing to him.

9. ¶ And a remnant of thy seed shall follow my brother, Esau, and shall find YHVH{a} by his seed, and epistles{b} of wisdom{c} shall come from the tongue of thy seed;
[a] See YHVH
[b] Hebrew, "Sefer;" "writings" or "books"
[c] This may refer to Rasa'il al-Hikmah, a collection of sacred texts and letters belonging to the Druze Faith

10. And these shall reject truth at first, but then they shall make their camp to the East and at last remember YHVH.

11. And thy seed shall be blessed, and their blessings shall pour out over all Israel, that the blessings of Israel should extend to the whole of the earth,

12. That in that day, none in the boarders of Israel should starve or parish but should be saved.

13. ¶ And at the last days, the daughter of Zion{a} shall stand forth, and remind the earth of their covenant with YHVH, and return the cup of Elohim{b} to the temple, that libations{c} might be poured upon the altar,
[a] See Daughter of Zion
[b] In the ancient Near East "cup" was used as a metaphor for fate; here it is a feminine noun, representing both the Divine Feminine and the will of God
[c] Hebrew, "to pour," or "to pour out;" see Libation

14. And that that which was hidden should be found, and that which had been in darkness shall come to light.

15. And a cloth shall be placed over her{a}, to hide her, yet YHVH shall make her as to shine, that none shall see the tarp, but only that light from within.
[a] See Daughter of Zion

16. And thy daughters shall stand ready to feed the earth, and to care for her creation, and to bless and to heal the sick, and to stand at the altars.

17. And thy sons shall go out with hands extended, giving alms to the poor, and giving goods with no price, and shall want for nothing, and shall ask for nothing, but shall give as YHVH hath bless them.

18. And thy seed shall have compassion in their hearts towards the bowels of mankind{a}, and for the beasts, and for the fowl of the air, and for the fish of the sea, and the plants; yea and all the creation of Ha’Elohim;
[a] Adam, Hebrew, "mankind"

19. And thou shall not seek to rule over Israel but shall be as a king among them.

20. ¶ And when Israel shall be as a man in the cold of winter with no shoes or coat{a}, Zebulun shall find him,
[a] Or "naked"

21. And he shall give him meat from his house, and the shoes off his feet, and the coat that is upon him.

22. And when Israel has grown sick from fever, Zebulun shall give him to eat, and to drink, and shall care for him until he is again well;

23. For thy seed shall be as the waters, divided by the land, yet always seeking the path back that ye may gather as one again;

24. Therefore, teach thy seed that they are to correct without malice, and not be consumed by anger, and this that they shall be brought when the time of YHVH shall come in.

[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] See Ha’Elohim
[c] This may be a play on words as the rose is a symbol of Israel, and the Magdaline Priesthood

2. For she taketh the cup of the salvation of Israel, and pours libations{a} upon the altar of YHVH{b};
[a] Hebrew, "to pour," or "to pour out;" see Libation
[b] See YHVH

3. Therefore, her throne shall be found in all of Israel, and she shall come down from the North{a} as the South{b} shall come up, and the East{c} and the West{d} shall embrace her.

4. For in that day that Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw thee, his passion was drawn{a}, and his soul clung to thee;
[a] See Genesis 34

5. And he loved thee and spoke to thee tenderly in his passions; and he declared unto his father: Get me this young maiden as my wife.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that thy brothers, Simeon and Levi, did hear rumors most foul; that this man should take thee, and to lie with thee by force;

7. Therefore, did they do this crime unto me, saying: That all of the house of Hamor should damage{a} themselves for this marriage to come to pass.
[a] Or "circumcise"

8. And even after the house of Hamor accepted this deception, thy brothers, Simeon and Levi, did come into their house to wage war and to kill them and to rob them, and to defile them;

9. For they saw this mingling of blood as the mingling of the poor and the unpoor, the unholy and the holy, and they became even that which they had feared:

10. They saw not that thou should bring YHVH{a} unto the house of Hamor, but only that his house was unworthy.
[a] See YHVH

11. And my house did give up much to keep the peace between Israel and the Canaanites and Perizzites, that they not unite against me and attack me, that Israel be not destroyed.

12. And now we see that thy marriage is strong{a}, and that the House of Hamor is no more, but is as one of Israel, through thee, my daughter.
[a] This appears to teach that inner faith marriages can be a blessing

13. ¶ And in the third{a} year, the twelfth{b} month shall fall twice as the spring should come in, that Israel shalt regain her strength, that when the summer arises, her joy should come in;
[a] In leap years, Adarbet or Adar II becomes the thirteenth month, keeping the holy days of this month; see Adar
[b] It is by the harvest that the leap year is determined

14. For by the fruit of thy labors shall Israel be united with all the creation, that the fullness might come in;

15. Therefore, by the fruit of the trees{a} shall Israel know that thy month hath come in.
[a] It is by the harvest that the leap year is determined

16. ¶ And in the last days, after the sons of Israel cease to put aside their wives and their daughters, and the Face of Elohim{a} hath no longer been forgotten, thou shall be remembered, my daughter;
[a] The Face of Elohim is an allusion to the Divine Goddess, Heavenly Mother; see Shekinah

17. And my sons shall regain their strength as they return unto thee thy birthright, and make thy paths known, and keep thy secrets no longer.

18. For thy brothers, Simeon and Levi, these did ask of me: Shall he make our sister like a harlot?

19. Yet in their rash anger, and in their violence, they did treat thee as such, seeing thee as a possession to own, and not as the strength that thou art;

20. Therefore, in the last days when thy brother Levi shall remember their sister, and when Simeon shall see thy strength, thou shalt return again Israel from blindness and vengeance unto peace.

21. And the dove of peace{a} shall be made known, and the Tree of Life{b} shall bear fruit, and thy daughters shall serve Israel even as thy brothers, and the flowers shall bloom again upon the earth.

[a] See YHVH

4. And thy seed shall spring forth as one gone over a well, and YHVH shall rise up from thee a righteous branch from the fruit of thy loins;

5. ¶ And in the sixth{a} month, even at the time of the harvest, thy seed shall be sent out for the last time that the crops may be gathered, and Israel fed.
[a] NO NOTE!

6. And the time of harvest shall surely come in; for the kingdom of YHVH Elohim{a} is an everlasting kingdom which shall not pass away;
[a] See YHVH Elohim

7. But the kingdoms of men are like a slumber in the heat of the day, which after the summer shall leave him should disappear;

8. And the bridegroomg shall become enraged, yet thy throne shall abide in strength.

9. Agile shall be thy hands, made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob{a}, in the Shepherd{b}, the Rock of Israel{c},
[a] Hebrew, "avir;" see Genesis 49:24, Psalm 132:2, Isaiah 49:26
[b] See Psalm 23 and Ezekiel 34:11-19, John 10:11-15
[c] Hebrew, "Tzur Yisrael;" a concept in Judaism that alludes to God (YHVH); see 2 Samuel 23:2-4, Psalm 19:15

10. Even by the Ha’Elohim of thy father, who shall help thee, by Elohim Shaddai{a}, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, and with blessings of the abyss that lies under, and with blessings of the breasts{b} and of compassion.
[a] See Elohim Shaddai
[b] Hebrew, "shad;" the breasts of a human female

11. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my ancestors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills;

12. And it shall come to pass that upon the head of Joseph, my son that was separated from his brethren, shall be the crown of Israel;

13. And my son, Manasseh, shall make camp to the West, and with thy brother Dan to the North, whilst thy son Ephraim shall make his camp to the West; for therein dwelleth the mercy of YHVH.

14. ¶ And at the last days YHVH shall raise up from thy seed one that shall restore the Torah{a} of YHVH unto my sons and my daughters;
[a] Hebrew, "Teachings," "Instructions" or "Law"

15. And he shall be born of Ephraim, and of Judah, and of Levi; but he shall be of the seed of Joseph and shall do the works of Ephraim.

16. And in that day, my children shall not be ready, and shall fight bitterly one with another until he shall fall that would restore my sons and my daughter to the Elohim of our fathers;

17. Yet he shall set the path straight, and shall once again call upon my daughters to heal the sick, and offer libations before the altar of YHVH.

18. And others will YHVH call up to finish his work, for he shall be taken before his time, and this because of the wickedness of mankind.

19. ¶ And in that day shall thy daughters shall reach out to find the lost sheep of the Shepherd{a}, and shall be leaders of men, and shall dream dreams and prophecy in the name of YHVH.
[a] See Psalm 23 and Ezekiel 34:11-19, John 10:11-15

20. And the daughter of Dan{a} shall do the works of Ephraim and shall help to finish that which the son of Joseph should begin;
[a] See 2 Moses 25:22-23

21. And many daughters shall be called upon to do the works of YHVH, and great and marvelous shall the works of YHVH be, even as such that the earth hath never before seen!

22. ¶ And thy sons shall fight one with another at the first, and that adversary{a} will be given power over them,
[a] See Satan

23. But a remnant shall come forth from Ephraim to unify my sons and daughters that the prophecies of YHVH that I have given unto Israel this day shall be made known and should come to pass;

24. For even as this remnant of the garment of my son, Joseph hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of Ha’Elohim,

25. And be taken unto Himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment;

26. Therefore, my son Joseph, continue to walk in the mitzvoth{a} of YHVH and El Elyon shall exalt thee and shall bless thee and thy seed with the good things of the earth and of the heavens forever and ever.

6. For thy seed shall find rest inward, even as a seed planted in the ground, that the roots may dig deep to find their nourishment,

8. And thy inner wisdom{a} shall grant thee and thy seed inner sight, and a gift of reading the stars,
[a] Wisdom can represent the Shekinah, inner wisdom the Holy Spirit, connecting the two

[a] In the ancient world the right hand was seen as being more favorable; in Egypt the left hand was used for curses while to the Israelites it was merely less favorable than the right hand; see Judges 3:15–21, 20:16, 1 Chronicles 12:2, Proverbs 3:16, Ecclesiastes 10:2, Matthew 25:31-46, 2 Corinthians 6:7

11. And for thy sins, they should nearly be destroyed, and lost after my son should again be separated,

12. But thy seed shall hide among thy brother, Judah, and shall be made safe that their ways of war should be lost, and their battle should shift from those around them to that within.

13. ¶ And thy camp shall be made to the West, that at the last days, thy sister, Dinah, shall find thee, and should bring thee home.

14. And the coat of many colors{a}, torn asunder by thy brethren, shall be sewn together once more, and shall be worn by thy brother, Joseph, in righteousness.
[a] See Coat of many colors

15. And in that day, thy daughters shall be freed from the captivity of thy sons, and shall shine forth as a light in the darkness to bring the glory of YHVH to the earth;

16. And a dove of peace{a} shall descend from thy seed and shall lead the daughters of Israel into battle, that they should remember their place.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh; Doctrines of the Saints 124:44-45

17. And thy sons shall kneel, and stand ashamed for their forbearance, and shall set aside their gains and divide their spoils that all of Israel should be free and reap the blessings of thy seed.

18. ¶ O remember, my son, that the sword of man{a} is the death of mankind{a}, and his blood shall cry out from the earth;
[a] Adam: Hebrew, "man," or "mankind"

19. Therefore, Benjamin, my son, be thou a follower of compassion, showing mercy to all mankind, even they with evil in their hearts for thee,

20. And showing the poor man mercy that the malakim{a} of the heavens should sing thy praises before YHVH.
[a] Hebrew, "angel," "envoy," or "messenger;" see Malak

21. Do this, and YHVH, even El Elyon{a}, shall give unto thee and thy seed an everlasting possession,
[a] See El Elyon

22. And that ye should no longer be called a ravenous wolf, but a worker of YHVH, giving nourishment to those in need, and doing works which are good in the sight of YHVH.

23. ¶ And all these are the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve sons of Jacob and his daughter also:

24. And these are the final words that their father, Jacob, spoke unto them and blessed them; everyone according to his blessing did he bless them.

chapter-aka: The Death of Jacob

1. And it came to pass that Jacob spoke unto his sons, and he did charge them and said unto them: I am to be gathered unto my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron, the Hittite,

2. In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which our father, Abraham bought{a} with the field of Ephron, the Hittite, for a possession of a burying place.
[a] See 1 Moses 32:32-34, 35:1; Genesis 23:1-20

3. For there they buried Abraham our father, and Sarah our mother, his wife;

4. And there too they buried Isaac our father, and Rebekah our mother, his wife; and there I buried Leah.

5. The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.

6. And when Jacob had made an end of commanding{a} his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people;
[a] Or "instructing"

7. And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.

8. ¶ And Jacob had lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; Jacob grew in YHVH{a} to the hundred forty and seventh degree{b}.
[a] See YHVH
[b] A period of growth; see 1 Moses 3:9

9. And it came to pass that Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Jacob.

10. ¶ And after forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed; and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying: If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying:

12. My father made me swear, saying: Lo, I die; in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.

13. Now, therefore, I pray thee, let me go up and bury my father; and I will come back here again.

14. And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

16. And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and the house of his father; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.

17. And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company.

18. And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan; and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

19. ¶ And it came to pass that when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said: This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians; wherefore, the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

20. And the sons of Jacob did unto him according as he commanded them;

21. For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place of Ephron, the Hittite, before Mamre.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that when the brethren of Joseph saw that their father was dead, they said: Joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

24. And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying: Thy father did command before he died, saying:

25. So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil;

26. And now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the Elohim{a} of thy father.
[a] See Elohim

27. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph wept when they spoke unto him.

28. And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said: Behold, we be thy servants.

29. And Joseph said unto them: Fear not; for am I in the place of Elohim?

30. But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but Ha’Elohim{a} meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive;
[a] See Ha'Elohim

31. Now, therefore, fear ye not; I will nourish you and your little ones.

32. And it came to pass that Joseph comforted his brothers and he spoke kindly unto them.

chapter-aka: The Vision of Joseph

1. And it came to pass that Joseph dwelt in Egypt; and Joseph and Asenath saw the children of their son Ephraim up unto even the third generation;

2. The children of Machir also, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon the knees of Joseph and Asenath.

3. ¶ And it came to pass that in his old age, Joseph said unto his brethren: I die and go unto my fathers; and I go down to my grave with joy.

4. The Elohim{a} of my father Jacob be with you, to deliver you out of affliction in the days of your bondage;
[a] See Elohim

5. For the angel of YHVH{a} hath visited me, and I have obtained a promise of YHVH{b} that out of the fruit of my loins YHVH Elohim{c} will raise up a righteous branch out of my loins;
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] See YHVH
[c] See YHVH Elohim

6. And unto thee, whom my father Jacob hath named Israel, a prophet (not the Messiah who is called Shiloh{a}); and this prophet shall deliver my people out of Egypt in the days of thy bondage.
[a] Hebrew: "He who is," another way of saying "I AM THAT I AM," a reference to the Messiah, Jesus Christ

7. And it shall come to pass that they shall be scattered again; and a branch shall be broken off and shall be carried into a far country;

8. Nevertheless, they shall be remembered in the covenants of YHVH when the Messiah cometh;

9. For he shall be made manifest unto them in the latter days, in the Spirit of power, and shall bring them out of darkness into light—out of hidden darkness and out of captivity unto freedom.

10. ¶ And a seer{a} shall YHVH my Elohim raise up, who shall be a choice seer unto the fruit of my loins.
[a] See Seer

11. Thus saith YHVH, the Elohim of my fathers unto me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins, and he shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins;

12. And unto him will I give commandment, that he shall do a work for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren;

13. And his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them, even to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers.

14. And I will give unto him a commandment{a}, that he shall do none other work, save the work which I shall command him;
[a] Mitzvah: Hebrew: "obligation," "tradition," or "commandment."

15. And I will make him great in mine eyes: for he shall do my work.

16. And he shall be great like unto Moses{a}, whom I have said I would raise up unto you, to deliver my people, O house of Israel.
[a] Hebrew, from the Hebrew verb meaning "to pull out" or "to draw out" (of water); see 3 Moses 2:27

17. And this Moses will I raise up, to deliver My people out of the land of Egypt, but a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins;

18. And unto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins;

19. And not to the bringing forth of my word only, saith YHVH, but to the convincing them of my Word, which shall have already gone forth among them;

20. Wherefore, the fruit of my loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write;

21. And that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doctrines, and laying down of contentions,

22. And establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days; and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith YHVH.

23. ¶ And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when my work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring thee, O house of Israel, saith YHVH.

24. Behold, that seer will YHVH bless; and they that seek to destroy him, shall be confounded:

25. For this promise, of which I have obtained of YHVH, of the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled; behold, I am sure of the fulfilling of this promise.

26. And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father,

27. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing which YHVH shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of YHVH shall bring my people unto salvation.

28. I am sure of this thing, even as I am sure of the promise of Moses: for the angel of YHVH hath said unto me: I will preserve thy seed forever.

29. ¶ And the angel of YHVH hath said: YHVH will raise up a Moses, and I will give power unto him in a rod{a}, and will give judgment unto him in writing;
[a] Hebrew, a shepherd's or walking staff; here a divining rod, a tool blessed and endowed with the power of God

30. Yet YHVH will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak much: for YHVH will not make him mighty in speaking;

31. But YHVH will write unto him the Torah{a}, by the finger of the hand of YHVH; and will make a spokesman for him.
[a] Hebrew, "Law," "Teachings," or "Instructions"

32. ¶ And the angel of YHVH said unto me also: YHVH will raise up unto the fruit of thy loins; and will make for him a spokesman;

33. And behold, YHVH will give unto him, that he shall write the writing of the fruit of thy loins, unto the fruit of thy loins; and the spokesman of thy loins shall declare it.

34. And the words which he shall write, shall be the words which is expedient in my wisdom, should go forth unto the fruit of thy loins;

35. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them from the dust:

36. For YHVH knoweth their faith, and they shall cry from the dust; yea, even teshuvah{a} unto their brethren, even that after many generations have gone by them.
[a] Hebrew, "return;" usually translated as "repentance," "grace" or "redemption" 

37. ¶ And it shall come to pass that their cry shall go, even according to the simpleness of their words:

38. Because of their faith, their words shall proceed forth out of my mouth unto their brethren, which are the fruit of thy loins;

39. And the weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith, unto the remembering of my covenant which I hath made unto thy fathers;

40. ¶ And the covenant which YHVH make with thee and thy seed, Joseph, is this: That wherever thy seed should dwell, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments{a}, they shall prosper in the land;
[a] Mitzvah: Hebrew: "obligation," "tradition,"

41. And inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments, they shall be cut off from my presence.

42. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph spoke unto them, saying: Teach thy children, therefore, bring them up in the right way that they should go, that they should not depart from it, and YHVH shall keep the covenants{a} and my seed shall never perish as long as the earth should stand;
[a] Hebrew feminine noun, "berith;" a divine constitution or ordinance with signs or pledges

43. Therefore, God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swore unto Abraham, and unto Isaac, and unto Jacob.

44. And Joseph confirmed many other things unto his brethren and took an oath of the children of Israel, saying unto them: Ha’Elohim{a} will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
[a] See Ha’Elohim

45. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph died, having reached the hundred and tenth degree.

46. And they embalmed him, and they put him in a coffin in Egypt; and he was kept from burial by the children of Israel, that he might be carried up and laid in the sepulcher with his father.

47. And it came to pass that when Israel left the land of Egypt, they did remember the oath which they swore unto him, their father, Joseph.
