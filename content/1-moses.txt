chapter-aka: The Creator

1. The words of Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh{a} which He spake unto Moses at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceeding high mountain;
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

2. And he saw The Creator{a} face to face, and he talked with Him;
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

3. And Ruach Hakodesh{a} was upon Moses; therefore, Moses could endure the Presence{b}.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] See Shekinah.

4. ¶ And The Creator spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I AM{a}: YHVH Elohim{b} Shaddai{c},
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh
[b] See YHVH Elohim
[c] See Shaddai

5. And Elolaum{a} is my name, for I am Aleph Tav{b} without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?
[a] See Elolaum
[b] See Aleph Tav

6. ¶ And behold, thou art my son; wherefore, look; and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands,

7. But not all; for my works are without end, and also my words, for they never cease;

8. Wherefore, no one can behold all my works except they behold all my Glory{a}, yea which is to behold my crown{b};
[a] See Ruach Hakodesh
[b] Hebrew, “Keter;” see Keter

9. And no man nor woman can behold all my glory, or my crown and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth.

10. ¶ And I have a work{a} for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of the Yachad Yachid Echad{b};
[a] See 3 Moses 3:15
[b] See Yachad Yachid Echad

11. And the Yachad is the Messiah{a} of the world forever and ever, full of Grace{b} and truth;
[a] See Messiah
[b] See Teshuvah

12. But there is no creator beside me; and all things are present with me, for I know them all.

13. ¶ And now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, Moses, my son; for thou art in the world, and now I show it unto thee.

14. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses looked and beheld the world upon which he was created.

15. And as Moses beheld the world, and the ends thereof, and all the children of man, which are and which were created, of the same he greatly marveled and wondered.

16. And The Presence{a} of Elohim{b} withdrew from Moses, that His Glory{c} was not upon Moses, and Moses was left unto himself;
[a] See Shekinah
[b] See Elohim
[c] See Ruach HaKodesh

17. And as Moses was left unto himself, he fell unto the earth.

18. ¶ And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his natural strength like unto man;

19. And Moses said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed;

20. But now mine eyes have beheld The Creator{a}, but not my natural but my spiritual eyes; for my natural eyes could not have beheld, for I should have withered and died in His presence;
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

21. But His Glory{a} was upon me, and I beheld The Presence{b}, for I was transfigured before The Creator.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] See Shekinah

22. ¶ And now it came to pass that as Moses had said these words, behold, the Adversary{a} came tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man{b}, worship me.
[a] See Satan
[b] See Son of man Echad

23. And it came to pass that Moses looked upon the Adversary and said: Who art thou?

24. For behold, I am a son of Elohim{a} in the similitude of the Yachad{b}; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?
[a] See Elohim
[b] See Yachad Yachid Echad

25. For behold, I could not look upon The Creator except The Presence should come upon me, and I were transfigured before Him.

26. But I can look upon thee in the natural man; is it not so surely?

27. Blessed be the name of my Creator, for The Glory of Elohim hath not altogether withdrawn from me; or else, where is thy glory?

28. For it is darkness unto me, and I can judge between the Accuser{a} and Elohim{b}.
[a] See Satan
[b] See Ha’Elohim

29. For The Creator said unto me: I have a work for thee; and also: There is no creator beside me.

30. Get thee hence, Accuser; deceive me not;

31. For The Creator said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of the Yachad Yachid Echad.

32. And He also gave unto me teshuvah{a} when He called unto me out of the burning bush, saying: Call upon Elohim in the name of the Yachad{b}, and worship The Creator.
[a] See Teshuvah
[b] See Yachad Yachid Echad

33. ¶ And again, Moses said: I will not cease to call upon The Creator{a}.
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

34. I have other things to inquire of Him; for The Glory of Elohim{a} has been upon me, and it is glory unto me; wherefore, I can judge between The Creator and thee.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

35. Depart hence, thou Satan, thou Adversary, thou Accuser!

36. ¶ And now, when Moses had said these words, the Adversary cried with a loud voice, and went upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am Yachad Yachid Echad{a}, worship me!
[a] See Yachad Yachid Echad

37. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of Sheol{a};
[a] See Sheol

38. Nevertheless, calling upon The Creator, Moses received strength.

39. And Moses commanded, saying: Depart hence, Satan; for this one, Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh, only will I worship, which is given me by Ruach HaKodesh{a}.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

40. ¶ And now, the Adversary began to tremble, and the earth shook.

41. And Moses received strength and called upon the Creator in the name of the Yachad, saying to the Adversary: Depart hence in the name of Yachad Yachid Echad!

42. ¶ And it came to pass that this Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and departed hence, yea, from the presence of Moses, that he beheld him not.

43. ¶ And it came to pass that when the Adversary departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted up his eyes unto heaven, being filled by The Glory of Elohim{a}, which beareth record of Avinu{b} and of Yachad;
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] See Avinu

44. And calling upon the name of the Creator, he beheld again The Presence{a}; for it rested upon him,
[a] See Shekinah

45. And he heard The Voice{a}, saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, Elohim Shaddai{b} have chosen thee;
[a] See The Voice
[b] See Elohim Shaddai

46. And thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy decree even as if thou{a} wert the Creator.
[a] See 3 Moses 4:27

47. ¶ And lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days; for thou shalt deliver my people from bondage, even Israel{a}, my chosen peoples.
[a] See Israel

[a] See Ruach Hakodesh

3. Yea, and he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which he beheld not;

5. And he beheld many lands, and each land was called earth; and there were inhabitants on the face thereof.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses called upon The Creator{a}, saying: Tell me, I pray thee, why these things are so and by what thou madest them.
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

7. And behold, The Glory of Elohim was upon Moses, so that Moses stood in The Presence{a} of Elohim{b}, and he talked with The Creator face to face{c}.

[c] A pun of sorts, another way of saying “the Glory of God was upon (him/ her)”

8. ¶ And YHVH Elohim{a} said unto Moses: For mine own purpose have I made these things;
[a] See YHVH Elohim

9. Here is Wisdom{a}, and it remaineth{b} in me;
[a] A play on words, “Chokhmah,” another term for Shekinah
[b] Remaineth: Another play on words, as another translation could read, “and is one,” or “The Creation is one in the Creator,” saying that The Creator (the Father) and the Creation (the Mother) are one. We see this idea reflected when Christ calls himself the Groom and the Church his bride.

11. And worlds without number have I created, and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Yachad I created them;

[a] Adam: Hebrew, “mankind.”

13. But only an account of this earth and the inhabitants thereof give I unto you;

14. For behold, there are many worlds{a} which have passed away by the Word of My Power{b}; and there are many also which now stand, and numberless are they unto mankind{c};
[a] See Midrash Rabbah; Genesis 3:7
[b] See 1 Moses 2:10
[c] Hebrew, “mankind”

15. But all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine, and I know them.

16. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses spake unto The Creator, saying: Be merciful unto thy servant, O Creator, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens; and then thy servant will be content.

17. ¶ And YHVH Elohim{a} spoke unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and innumerable unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine;
[a] See YHVH Elohim

18. And as one{a} earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof, even so shall another come;
[a] See Legends of the Jews 1:1

19. And there is no end to my works, neither to my words:

20. For this is my Work and my Glory{a}: to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of mankind{b}.
[a] Hebrew feminine nouns; what The Creator gains from the Creation; see Male and female
[b] Adam: Hebrew, “mankind.”

21. ¶ And now, Moses, my Tzadik Yachad{a}, I will speak unto you concerning this earth upon which you stand; and you shall write the things which I shall speak.

22. And in a day when the children of man shall esteem my words as naught and take many of them from the book which you shall write, behold, I will raise up another like unto you;

23. And my Word{a} shall be had again among the children of man{b}, among even as many as shall believe.
[a] See 1 Moses 2:10

32. But as for Adam{a}, there was not found a helpmate for them.
[a] Adam, mankind 

33. ¶ And YHVH Elohim saw that Adam flowed over with sadness, and they slept;

34. And YHVH rent the veil and found Ishshah{a};

35. And YHVH brought this one from the hillside, out of the world of humans{a}; and bringing her from the lower to the upper world, closed up the veil.
[a] Adam, Hebrew, “Mankind”

36. And YHVH sealed up the flesh{a} in the stead thereof; which is to say that YHVH Elohim{b} brought forth an equal{c} to be one with them from among the children of man{d};
[a] They became one flesh, they were bonded in marriage

1. And Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh{a}, spake unto Moses, saying: That Accuser{b}, whom thou hast ordered in the name of mine Yachad Yachid Echad{c}, is the same which was from the beginning;
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh
[b] See Satan
[c] See Yachad Yachid Echad

2. And he{a} came before me, saying: Behold I; send me.
[a] He, Satan

3. I will be thy Yachad{a}; and I will redeem all of Adam{b}, that one soul shall not be lost;
[a] See Tzadik Yachad
[b] Hebrew, “mankind”

4. And surely I will do it; wherefore, give me thine honor.

5. ¶ But behold, my Yachad{a}, which was my beloved and chosen from the beginning, said unto me, Avinu{b}: Hineni{c}; thy will be done, and The Glory{d} be thine forever.
[a] Maybe Michael that is Adam; see Abraham 3:24, Tzadik Yachad
[b] Hebrew, “Father,” a name for God.
[c] See Hineni

6. Wherefore, because that Adversary{a} rebelled against me and sought to destroy the agency of Adam{b}, which YHVH Elohim{c} had given them,
[a] See Satan
[b] Hebrew, “mankind”
[c] See YHVH

7. And also that The Creator{a} should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Yachad{b} it was caused that he should be cast down;
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh
[b] See Yachad Yachid Echad

8. And he became Satan{a}, yea, even the devil{b}, the father of all lies, to deceive, and to blind Adam{c}, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my Voice{d}.
[a] See Satan, might be everyone outside the Garden
[b] Devil: one unworthy of worship, a head demon; one who leads humans astray, a tempter
[c] Or “the humans”
[d] See The Voice

9. ¶ And now, this devil was as a serpent{a}, and more subtle than any beast of the field which YHVH Elohim{b}, had made.
[a] See Book of Remembrance 2:32-34; 4:18; 7:8, 11
[b] See YHVH Elohim

10. And after the first{a} had left the Garden, that Adversary{b} put into his heart to beguile Eve; for he had drawn away many{c} after him.
[a] Likely Lilith, See Book of Remembrance 5:25
[b] See Satan
[c] It is unknown who this “many” are, they 

11. And Eve he sought also; for he knew not the mind of Elohim{a}; wherefore, he sought to destroy the Creation.
[a] See Elohim

12. ¶ And the Adversary said unto the Ishshah{a}: Yea, hath Elohim said: Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden, and he spake with the tongue of a serpent.
[a] Ishshah: “woman,” Eve, representing the will to receive.

13. ¶ And the woman said unto this serpent: We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;

14. But of the fruit of the tree which thou beholdest in the midst of the garden, Elohim hath said: Ye shall not eat of it; neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

15. ¶ And the serpent said unto the woman: Ye shall not surely die;

16. For Elohim doth know that in the day thou eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as the elohim{a}, knowing good and evil.
[a] “Gods,” here denoting the Children of Elohim, the children of Yah, God the Father & Mother, or the Masculine and Feminine aspects of God, or the Children of God

17. ¶ And when the woman saw that the Tree was good for food, and that it became pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make her wise,

18. She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband{a} with her; and he did eat.
[a] Adam, representing the desire to bestow.

19. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they had been naked{a};
[a] See Book of Remembrance 9:19-20

20. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons{a}.
[a] Genesis 3:7 states “fig leaves” while the Hebrew presented over the plates of brass is “chagowrah,” a belt or girdle, and the Egyptian reads “aprons”

21. ¶ And they heard the Voice of YHVH Elohim as they were walking in the garden in the cool of the day.

22. And Adam and his wife went to hide themselves from the presence of YHVH Elohim{a} amongst the trees of the garden.
[a] See YHVH Elohim

23. ¶ And YHVH Elohim called unto Adam and said unto them: Where goest thou?

24. And they said: I heard thy Voice in the garden and was afraid because we beheld that we were naked; and we hid ourselves.

25. ¶ And YHVH Elohim said unto Adam: Who told thee that thou wast naked?

26. Hast thou eaten of the Tree whereof it was given charge unto thee that thou shouldest not eat; if so, thou shouldest surely die?

27. ¶ And the man said: The woman whom thou gavest me, and decreed that she should remain with me; she gave me of the fruit of the Tree; and I did eat.

28. And YHVH Elohim said unto the woman: What is this thing which thou hast done?

29. ¶ And the woman said: The serpent, Satan, beguiled me, and I didst eat.

30. ¶ And YHVH Elohim said unto that Accuser{a}: Because thou hast done this, thou shalt be cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field;
[a] See Satan

31. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.

32. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed;

33. And they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

34. ¶ Unto the woman YHVH Elohim said: I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception{a};
[a] Conception: here referring to new desires, the pain being the difficulty in receiving, the will to receive being the natural “female” desire

35. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy longing shall be to thy husband, and he shall care and provide for thee.

36. ¶ And unto Adam YHVH Elohim said: Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the fruit of the tree of which I offered thee in teshuvah{a}, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed shall be the ground for thy sake;
[a] Teshuvah: “return.” The return back to God, usually translated as “repentance,” “redemption,” or “grace”

37. In toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.

38. Thorns also and thistles{a} shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
[a] Thorns and thistles: both masculine, here showing that it will be harder to bestow, which is the natural “male” desire. referring to new desires, pain from the difficulty in receiving; see Male and female

39. By the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread until thou shalt return unto the ground, for thou shalt surely die;

40. For out of the earth wast thou taken; for dust thou wast, and unto dust shalt thou return.

41. ¶ And Adam called the name of his wife Eve, for she was the mother of all living;

42. For thus has YHVH Elohim, called the first of all women, which are many.

43. Unto Adam and also unto his wife did YHVH Elohim make coats of skins and clothed them.

44. ¶ And the The Creator{a} said unto Yachad{b}: Behold, mankind has become as one of us, to know good and evil;
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh
[b] See Yachad Yachid Echad

45. And now, lest they put forth their hand and partake also of the Tree of Life{a}, and eat, and live forever, let us send them forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground in the lands from whence they were taken.
[a] En Sof; see 1 Nephi 3:46-47 RAV, 11:8-9 OPV

46. For as YHVH Elohim liveth, even so these words cannot return void, for as they go forth out, they must be fulfilled;

47. And so the people{a} were thus driven out of The Presence{b} of Elohim{c};
[a] Hebrew, “mankind”
[b] See Shekinah
[c] See Elohim

48. And YHVH{a} placed at The Presence of the East{b} of the garden of Eden, cherubim{c} and a sword of flame, which turned every way to guard the pathway towards the Tree of Life.

1. And it came to pass that after YHVH Elohim{a} had driven them out, that mankind{b} began to till the earth, and to take charge over all the beasts of the field;
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] Adam, Hebrew, “mankind”

2. And to eat their bread by the sweat of their brow, as YHVH{a} had decreed; for Eve also, the wife, did labor with them.
[a] See YHVH

3. ¶ And Adam knew his wife, and she bare unto him sons and daughters.

4. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH Elohim called unto the man, Adam; and Adam answered, saying: Hineni{a};
[a] See Hineni

5. And Adam and Eve did hearken unto the Voice{a} of Yah{b} and called upon their sons and daughters to walk in teshuvah{c}.
[a] See The Voice
[b] See Yah
[c] See Teshuvah

6. And thus all things were confirmed unto Adam and Eve by an holy ordinance{a}, and the proclamation of Shalom{b} was preached;
[a] See Book of Remembrance 10-21
[b] “The proclamation of peace,” or “the Gospel,” or “the good news.”

7. And a decree sent forth, that the Good News should be in the world until the end thereof.

8. And mankind hearkened unto the Voice of Yah and called upon their sons and daughters to walk in teshuvah.

9. And the Proclamation of Shalom began to be preached from the beginning, being declared by holy angels sent forth from the Presence{a} of Elohim{b}, and by The Voice of Yah, and by The Gift{c} of Ruach HaKodesh{d}.
[a] See Shekinah
[b] See Elohim
[c] The Gift: Masculine noun, “the endowment;” referring here to the connection between mankind and the God
[d] See Ruach HaKodesh

10. And these began to share the Proclamation of Shalom, and thus did they multiply and replenish{a} the earth.
[a] See Book of Remembrance 17:59

11. And from that time forth, the sons and daughters of Adam began to divide, two and two{a}, in the land, and to till the land, and to tend flocks; and they also begat sons and daughters.
[a] A way to say they divided up

12. ¶ And Adam called upon the name of YHVH, and Eve also, his wife;

13. And they heard the Voice of YHVH from the way towards the garden of Eden, speaking unto them;

14. And they saw Him not, for they were shut out from The Presence of Elohim.

15. And YHVH gave unto them teshuvah{a}, that they should worship YHVH, their Elohim, and should gift the firstlings of their flocks for an offering{b} unto YHVH.
[a] or "grace," see Teshuvah
[b] It is unclear if this refers to a ritualistic animal blood sacrifice or if they were given to the poor, or both

16. And they, Adam, were obedient unto YHVH in teshuvah.

17. ¶ And after many days, the angel of YHVH{a} appeared unto this man, Adam, saying: Why dost thou gift this, thy offering, unto YHVH?
[a] See Angel of YHVH

18. And Adam said unto him: I know not, save YHVH spake it unto me.

19. And then spake the angel saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Yachad Yachid Echad{a} of Avinu{b}, which is full of Grace and truth{c};
[a] See Yachad Yachid Echad
[b] See Avinu
[c] Grace and truth: Grace here is “Teshuvah,” the way back to God, usually translated as “repentance,” “redemption,” or “grace;” truth is “faithful,” or “faithfulness;” both are feminine nouns; see Teshuvah

20. Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of YHVH.

21. And thou shalt walk in teshuvah and call upon Elohim in the name of the Yachad forevermore.

22. ¶ And in that day, the Spirit of YHVH{a} fell upon the man Adam, which beareth record of Elohim Avinu, Shekinah, and Yachad, saying: I AM, the Yachad Yachid Echad of Elohim, from the beginning, henceforth and forever; Aleph Tav;
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

23. Even as thou hast fallen, thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind{a} —even as many as will receive.
[a] Adam, Hebrew, “mankind”

24. ¶ And in that day, Adam blessed YHVH in The Presence of Elohim, and was filled even by the Spirit of YHVH,

25. And the man Adam began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of YHVH; for because of my transgression, mine eyes are opened;

26. And in this life I shall have joy, and again, in the flesh I shall see my Creator{a}.
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

27. ¶ And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our trespass, we never should have had seed{a} and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our teshuvah, and the eternal life which YHVH giveth unto all the obedient.
[a] See 1 Moses 6:10

28. And Adam and Eve blessed the name of YHVH; and they made all things known unto their sons and their daughters.

29. ¶ And that Accuser{a} came among their sons and daughters, saying: I am also a Yachad Yachid Echad{b};
[a] See Satan
[b] See Yachad Yachid Echad

30. And it came to pass that that Adversary{a} commanded them, saying: Believe it not.
[a] See Satan

31. And they believed it not; and they loved Satan more than their Creator.

32. ¶ And mankind{a}, having seen the light and comprehending it not{b} began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish;
[a] Hebrew, “Adam”
[b] See John 1:5

33. For these had known of Elohim yet sought out the desires of their flesh.

34. ¶ And YHVH Elohim{a}, called upon Adam, which is to say mankind, everywhere by Ruach HaKodesh{b}, and offered unto them teshuvah; in tikkun ha-olam{c};
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] See Ruach HaKodesh
[c] See Tikkun ha-olam

35. And as many as believed in Yachad and repented of their sins should be saved;

36. And as many as believed not and walked not in teshuvah should be damned.

37. And the Word{a} went forth out of the Mouth of Elohim{b} in a firm decree; wherefore, they must be fulfilled.
[a] See Word
[b] See Mouth of Elohim

38. And the man, Adam, ceased not to call upon Yah{a}; and Eve also, his wife.

chapter-aka: The Oath

1. And Adam was intimate with Eve, his wife; and she conceived and bare Cain{a}, which is to say: acquired in pain;
[a] Cain: Chayn, "to get"

2. And the woman said: I have gotten a man from YHVH{a}; wherefore, he may not reject the words of YHVH.
[a] See YHVH

3. But, behold; Cain hearkened not, saying: Who is YHVH, that I should know him?

4. ¶ And she again conceived and bare his brother Abel{a}, which is to say: my breath; and Abel hearkened unto The Voice{b} of YHVH.
[a] Able: "Habel," breath
[b] See The Voice

5. ¶ And Abel was a keeper of sheep{a}, and Cain was a tiller of the ground{b}.
[a] Representing his ministry
[b] Representing his own selfish desires

6. And Cain loved the Accuser{a} more than YHVH.
[a] See Satan

7. And by the voice of Lilith{a}, the Adversary{b} commanded Cain, saying: Make an offering unto YHVH.
[a] See Book of Remembrance 5:39
[b] See Satan

8. ¶ And it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground{a} an offering unto YHVH.
[a] Referring to his own selfish desires; an offering of sin, rather a sin offering 

9. And Abel, he brought the best from among the firstlings of his flock{a}, and YHVH had respect unto Abel and to his offering;
[a] His desire to give and receive in the name of God

10. But unto Cain and to his offering YHVH turned His gaze away, for this sacrifice was unto the man{a}, and not unto YHVH.
[a] Or "unto himself," referring to his egoism

11. ¶ Now the Adversary knew this, and it pleased him, for he desired another in the flesh to pollute the seed;

12. And Cain was very wroth, and he became defiant, having failed.

13. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Cain: Why art thou wroth? Why is thy face black{a}, and thy soul sleepeth{b}?
[a] Or "skin black;" referring to his presence, unlike the feminine Shekinah, this is a male (selfish) and fallen presence; one that once had the light of God, but lost that light
[b] Or "been drawn into your own egoism"

14. If thou doest that which is pleasing, thou shalt be exalted; and if thou doest refuseth, sin lieth at the door.

15. Seek not to fulfill thy own desires{a}, but take possession of thyself, or that Accuser shall have thee;
[a] His ego, or egoism

16. And except thou shalt hearken unto the Word{a} of my teshuvah{b}, I will deliver thee up; and know thou that this shall be unto thee according to thy desire:
[a] See Word
[b] See Teshuvah

17. For behold, thou art the ruler over him; and from this time forth, thou shalt be the father of his lies{a};
[a] We cannot blame Satan for our actions, good or bad, the consequences are ours because the decisions are ours

18. And thou shalt be called Perdition{a}, for thou wast also before the world{b};
[a] See Perdition
[b] See Abraham 3:25-26, Book of Remembrance 2:18-22

19. And it shall be said in time to come that these abominations{a} were had from Cain, for thou hast rejected the greater counsel which was had from Elohim{b}:
[a] See Abominations
[b] See Elohim

20. And this is the curse which shall be upon thee, except thou enter into teshuvah{a}.
[a] See Teshuvah

21. And Cain was wroth and listened not any more to The Voice{a} of YHVH{b}, neither to Abel his brother, who walked in holiness before YHVH;
[a] See The Voice
[b] See YHVH

22. And Adam also and his wife mourned before YHVH because of Cain and his brethren.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that Cain took the daughter of one of his brothers to wife, and they both loved the Accuser{a} more than YHVH;
[a] See Satan

24. Yet Cain desired the wife of Abel, his twin; and thus knowing that YHVH should not give her unto him, for YHVH Elohim{a} shall not divide that which is sealed to give unto another,
[a] See YHVH Elohim

25. Thus Cain, desiring to make a way, sought counsel from that serpent{a} that has deceived so many.
[a] See Satan

26. And that Adversary{a} said unto Cain: Swear unto me by thy throat; and if thou tell it, thou shalt die;
[a] See Satan

27. And swear thy brethren by their heads and by Elohim Chaiyim{a}, that they tell it not; for if they tell it, they shall surely die:
[a] Elohim Chaiyim: "the living God"

28. And this that thy father may not know it; and this day I will deliver thy brother Abel into thine hands.

29. And the Accuser swore unto Cain that he would do according to his commands:

30. And all these things were done in secret.

31. ¶ And Cain said: Truly I am Mahan{a}, the master of this great secret, that I may murder and get gain;
[a] Mahan: "great one," or "master of a great secret"

32. Wherefore, Cain was called Master Mahan; and he gloried in his wickedness.

33. ¶ And it came to pass that Cain went into the field, and Cain talked with Abel, his brother;

34. And it came to pass that while they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him.

35. And Cain gloried in that which he had done, saying: I am free; surely all that belongeth to my brother shall fall into my hands.

36. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH came unto Cain, and said: Where is Abel, thy brother?

37. And Cain said: I know not; am I my brother's keeper{a}?
[a] Or "is it up to me to keep my brother safe?"

38. And YHVH said: What hast thou made this day? Listen! For the voice of the blood of thy brother calls out unto me from the ground;

39. And now, thou hast brought the very curse{a} that I had spoken unto thee before upon thine own head;
[a] See 1 Moses 7:21-23 

40. For the earth hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand:

41. And now, when thou tillest the soil it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a vagabond and a fugitive shalt thou be upon the earth.

42. And Cain said: That Accuser, he tempted me because of the flocks of my brother; and I was wroth also, for his offering thou didst accept, and not mine;

43. And now my guilt is greater than I can carry!

44. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from The Presence{a} of Elohim{b}, and Thy Face{a} shall be as a secret kept from me; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth;
[a] See Shekinah
[b] See Elohim

45. And it shall come to pass that he that findeth me will murder me; and this because of mine iniquities; for I have murdered, and these things are not hid from YHVH.

46. ¶ And YHVH said unto him: No! For whosoever shall slay thee have also done murder, just as you; vengeance shall be taken on them sevenfold;

47. And this because the sheading of the blood of man{a} only leads to the sheading of more blood.
[a] Hebrew, “mankind”

48. And YHVH gave charge unto Cain a sign, lest any finding him should smite this one.

49. ¶ And Cain was shut out from The Presence of Elohim with his wife and many of their kin;

50. And these dwelt in the land of Nod{a}, on the east side, even the Face of Eden{b}.
[a] “To wander;” they wandering in front of Eden, this is to say they walked in blindness, as they no longer knew the Lord, YHVH

1. And Cain was intimate with his wife, and she conceived and bare Chanoch{a}; and he also begat many sons and daughters.
[a] Chanoch: Enoch, "dedicated"

2. ¶ And it came to pass that Cain built an encampment with a tower to watch over the land in the which they wandered, where they could plant seed and grow crops;

3. And the people came and went as they pleased, taking unto themselves that which they desired;

4. And Cain called the name of the place after the name of his son, Chanoch.

5. ¶ And unto Chanoch was born Irad{a} and other sons and daughters; and Irad begat Mechuyael{b} and other sons and daughters.
[a] Irad: "the dragon"
[b] Mechuyael: Mehujael, "smitten of God"

[b] Lemech: Lamech, "man of strength"

7. ¶ And Lemech took unto himself two wives: the name of one being Adah{a}, and the name of the other, Tzillah{b};
[a] Adah: "adornment"
[b] Zillah, "shadow" 

8. For behold, Lemech made that same oath with the Adversary{a} that his forefather, Cain{b}, had taken;
[a] See Satan
[b] See 1 Moses 7:31-35

9. And having sealed the oath in blood, the Adversary came to him, venturing him to take{a} unto himself another wife, as a possession to satisfy his own lusts.
[a] A wicked corrupted form of polygamy, rejecting oneness, as the man is taking the second wife, not the couple as one; see Polygamy

8. Yeah, they placed the veil between they and their father and their mother, that none could see in;

9. And they saw not their father nor their mother in their purity{a}.

10. ¶ And Noah and Na’amah awoke from their visions and knew what their youngest son had done unto them;

19. And this because in that day Ham did reject The Presence{a} of Elohim, and because they left their family they did not know, and thus they could no longer teach them or be taught the things of Elohim.

And each time, after teaching and instructing their children, Noah and Na’amah would say: For thus did Enoch teach his son, Methuselah, and Methuselah his son Lamech, and Lamech did teach all this unto me as his father had bidden him; and now I do teach you, my children, even as Enoch taught his children.

9. And even as Enoch did, in his generation, teach these sayings unto all that were Zion, for these are the commandments that teach us the Torah of YHVH;

10. And he did testify it unto his children and his children's children, until the day they were taken unto Elohim{a}.
[a] See Elohim

11. ¶ And it came to pass that as the children of Noah and Na’aham and the children of their children had gone out into the world to possess their portions, the sa'iyr and the shed{a} did come amongst them;
[a] Hebrew, maybe "satyr and demon," or "demon and devilish spirit"

12. And these began to seduce the men and women, and they did torment them with pains, and all manner of suffering even unto death{a}.
[a] The original writing on the plates of brass implies spiritual or physical death, or both

13. And it came to pass that the children of Elohim{a} did pour their hearts out unto YHVH and He did send forth Raphael{b}, the angel of healing, to help banish the sa'iyr and the shed from out of the lands.
[a] See Children of Elohim
[b] See Raphael

14. ¶ And it came to pass that the children of man{a} had again grown strong in numbers, and so too then the sa'iyr and the shed through them.
[a] See Children of men

15. And Raphael did go forth to heal the sick and did remind the children of Elohim of all the remedies of the plants, that they might resort to these as was needed,

16. And they did write these down in a book, that they should have his wisdom forever, and this they did pass down from generation to generation.

17. And unto those with the gift to heal, and those with the gift of being healed, to these Raphael did give some of the wood from the branches of the tree of life, and the hope of the sa'iyr and the shed was frustrated.

18. And Raphael went his way, by the direction of YHVH; and the children of Elohim and the children of man did go on about their ways, and so the spread of the corruption of mankind{a} did begin again to increase,
[a] Hebrew, "Adam"

19. For whilst Noah and Na’amah still lived, they had three sons, one of which was cast from the Presence{a}; and his name was Ham.
[a] See Shekinah 

20. ¶ And it came to pass that it became known to Ham that his father had cursed him, and thus he, being ashamed, fled with his wife, Neelatamauk;

21. And it came to pass that their family did build a village and did settled there, and he did name it after his wife.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that Ham begot Crush, who begot Enmer{a} when he was great of age;
[a] See Nimrod

23. And it came to pass that Crush did give unto his son the very garments{a} with which YHVH Elohim had given unto Adam and Eve upon their leaving the garden.
[a] See Book of Remembrance 13:3

24. And Cush himself was given them of Ham, for Ham had taken{a} them unknownst to Noah and Na’aham and had kept them concealed,
[a] See 1 Moses 14:15

25. And these he had passed on to his firstborn son, who had kept them hidden; and when Enmer did reach his twelfth year, his father, Crush, did give them unto him.

26. ¶ And it came to pass that Enmer was a mighty hunter{a} before YHVH, and he did use hidden knowledge unknown to the sons and daughters of man, but known to the children of Elohim, of which his forefather Noah was.
[a] Can refer to hunting beasts, men, souls, or all three

27. And Enmer saw the glory of YHVH{a} was upon the garments that had been given him, and he did seek to be worthy of their purchase{b}.
[a] See Glory of YHVH
[b] Or "owning them" 

28. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH Elohim saw that Enmer wished to bless the land, and so it came to pass that YHVH did bless him;

29. And he became known as Enmer Kar, for he was a mighty hunter, even one mighty and strong before YHVH.

30. And it came to pass that YHVH did give them unto him in a dream, and YHVH Elohim did call him to hunt not for the meat of animals but for the souls of man unto YHVH;

31. Yea, and when he awoke, he did pick up his bow, and rent it twain, and did begin to call out as his forefathers had done saying: Pe le-El{a} !
[a] See Book of Remembrance 16:5

32. And it came to pass that Elohim sent the angel of YHVH{a} before him and by the voice of the angel YHVH did send him out into the land to teach by the Word{b} of the Holy Spirit{c}.
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] See Word
[c] See Ruach HaKodesh

33. And Enmer Kar did go forth unto his people as their king and did preach the Word of YHVH unto them, and many of their numbers were converted.

chapter-aka: The Word of Peace

1. And it came to pass that the descendants of Noah and Na’amah did appoint princes over each of their kingdoms;

2. And Enmer Kar{a} was chosen for those of the seed of Ham, and Joktan was chosen for those of the seed of Shem, and Phenech was chosen for those of the seed of Japheth.
[a] See Nimrod

3. And strangers did come into their lands; and some had been made fellow citizens{a}, and some had been made servants, and some had been made slaves, for the seed of Noah and Na’amah did not all follow the Torah{b} of YHVH.
[a]  The original text implies that the people of Enmer Kar made the immigrants their fellow citizens, while Joktan’s people made them servants, and Phenech’s people made them slaves; however, the spiritual impression and further chapter indicate that this is not literally true; see 1 Moses 18-19
[b] Hebrew, "Teachings," Instructions," or "Law"

4. And it began to be said across the lands: Behold, the time is coming and yet is nigh when neighbor shall be against neighbor, and brother against brother: for the last days{a} are here; and so one must carry on war against the other!
[a] The end was not actually coming, the people believed falsely that they were living in the end times; see 1 Moses 19:10

5. ¶ And it came to pass that Enmer Kar did call his people together, and unto them he said: Behold, my people, the people of this land given us of YHVH{a} !
[a] See YHVH

6. We who have come to possess the knowledge of the Torah of YHVH, have been entrusted with the inner keys{a} of the sanctuary, from whom those outside our lands have been withheld;
[a] Or "hidden/secret truths;" see 2 Nephi 11:92-93 RAV, 26:21-22a OPV

7. We who possess the wisdom of both the earth and the heavens have been called to build a house unto YHVH, and with this key{a} we shall open the door.
[a] Likely referring to the priesthood of God

8. I pray that we would continue to fear YHVH, that we should no more fear mankind, and we shall be well content; for our actions{a} have proved we fear YHVH, and He has protected us from all others.
[a] See Prosperity gospel

9. Therefore, I say unto thee, my people, that we should do no wrong one to another, yet I see that ye first hide your sins, that no human eyes may see;

10. Yet we know that YHVH who sees all things everywhere, and everything, from creation to creation, at all times doth see our sins; therefore, why should we hide our sins from our kindred?

11. Speak pleasantly then, one to another, and speak kindly to every one of us; in pacifying anger, in seeking peace, and in pursuit with our brethren and sistren, and so too then with all the world:

12. And by this means we shall gain favor and good feelings of understanding in the sight of YHVH Elohim and in the sight of all mankind.

13. And behold ye, that I wish the travelers and the sojourners to learn from the action I now order ye to perform:

14. How abhorrent dishonesty is to mine eyes; for it should be that we may be the peacemakers{a} and spread good feelings in this, our land, for we too come as pilgrims upon the earth,
[a] Hebrew, osei shalom, "makers of peace" or "doers of peace"

15. And all we possess belongs to YHVH, yet He continues to bless us continually, and to increase the pleasures{a} of our sojourn upon the earth.
[a] See Prosperity gospel

16. Should we then think, therefore, that to take from a man only to present to YHVH that which is His own be a sin?

17. Behold thou, that ye might think this should be allowed; but I would rebuked thee by the teachings of our fathers; for YHVH is just and condemns such and act.

18. For did not our forefathers teach us that a curse{a} should fall upon any who should stretch out their hand to take a portion they had not received?
[a] See 1 Moses 16:5

19. And if it is not given freely then is this not theft?

20. And if it is theft, then it is not of YHVH Elohim{a}, and thus we too should declare that it is not of us.
[a] See YHVH Elohim

21. But if a man should give willingly, then all should be blessed, for no harm was given, and no harm was taken.

22. And so it is that we who are guided by righteousness and justice in all the doings of YHVH may justly do that which we see{a} Him do in His unbounded charity towards His creation;
[a] See Matthew 5:45

23. Therefore, I say unto thee: Strive not to exalt thy own standing by speaking ill of thy neighbors, go not to thy sleep bearing hate towards thy fellow man,

24. But ask YHVH to forgive all they that have done thee harm, for the man that shall seek the sins{a} of his brother shall be judged even so by YHVH;
[a] See Matthew 7:1-5

25. Therefore, go thee by thy way and do thy duty, hide not thy sins in thy pride,

26. But find teshuvah{a} quickly, and judge not thy brother nor thy sister that we might discover peace here upon our lands in these, the last{b} days.
[a] See Teshuvah

chapter-aka: The Poor Widow’s Sons

1. And it came to pass that Enmer Kar{a} did gather his people as one in the name of YHVH{b}, and each were given charge over their duties that they might be one, even as was Zion{c}.
[a] See Nimrod
[b] See YHVH
[c] See Enoch 36:31

2. And unto some was it given{a} to plow the fields, and to plant, and to harvest, and to give fruits and grains to the storehouses;
[a] See Matthew 19:21; Mark 10:21b, Luke 18:22; Acts 2: 44-47; 4 Nephi 1:4 RAV, 1:3 OPV

3. And unto others was it given to herd the beasts of the fields, and give milk and meat that the storehouses should be full;

4. And unto others was it given to build houses that all might have a place to lay their heads at night, and to build houses for worship, and tabernacles, and other such buildings that the people might gather and have shelter from the storms;

5. And to others was it given to make walls, and unto others was it given to make all manner of weapons of war, and these to protect{a} all that they had made and were making;
[a] Indicating they lived in fear; see Joshua 1:9

6. And to others was it given to keep the peace and to pass judgement unto those that did break the laws.

7. And each went about in their duties, seeking to prepare themselves and their lands for the wars they knew would come{a}, and to protect themselves from the desolations they knew should be in the last days{a}.
[a] 1 Moses 17:4, 19:10

8. ¶ And it came to pass that many foreigners journeyed from the East towards Babel; and as they journeyed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there in the plain of Shinar.

9. And it came to pass that these foreigners came into the lands of Babel, and the people of Babel feared that these had come to bring the wars and desolation they knew should come at the last days.

10. And it came to pass that many of the strangers were gathered up and thrown into prisons, and these strangers began to suffer, for they knew not that the end was nigh.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that a certain widow and her sons were among those cast into prison, and these were brought before a certain judge;

12. And there the oldest son of the widow was commanded to pay homage to he that sitteth upon the judgement seat and to YHVH, their Elohim{a}.
[a] See Elohim

13. But the widow knew not the Elohim of their land, and she said unto her children: Behold this man that desires that we should bow to his image;

14. Yet know I not their elohim{a}; and so it should be that we shall not bow but for the fear of our gods{a}.
[a] See Elohim of man

15. And it came to pass that when her oldest son refused to bow, he was immediately led out to stand ready with those set apart for execution,

16. And then it was that the same judge brought forth the second son of that same widow, and upon him was made the same request.

17. And the second son replied unto the judge: My brother boweth not, neither then shall I bow down before thee.

18. And the judge grew angry in the face of his defiance and asked the second son why he should not bow.

19. And the second son answered him saying: Because thou hast found us, a widow{a} and her fatherless sons, strangers in this strange land, seeking safety and refuge; yet thou hast offered us not but prison and death;
[a] See Isaiah 10:1-2; Mormon 4:51-55 RAV, 8:38-40 OPV

20. Why for shouldest I bow unto thee? But I shall walk unto my death freely.

21. And the bravery of his words angered the judge, and this son too was sent off to be put to death.

22. And so it was unto the third, and the fourth, and the fifth, and the sixth, and even unto the seventh son.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that the record keeper did soften his heart towards the widow and her sons;

24. And the record keeper came before the judge saying: Behold, these art young, and hast seen but little of the joys of life that we here that are blessed of YHVH have been privy,

25. Therefore, should we not save them, and raise them up in the goodness of YHVH that their futures should be that these wouldst make a joyful noise unto YHVH?

26. But the judge pitied them not, saying: Let the sons of the poor widow be slain.

27. Then spoke the widow saying: O, thou cruel judge! Who art thou that destroys these innocent, young lives?

28. And she fell down as if dead and pleaded unto the judge: If thou must take a life away, take thou my life, and put me to death before the lives of my sons.

29. And the judge answered unto her saying: Nay, this I canst not do, for the law{a} forbids it, saying; Envy, covetousness, and jealousies are sins that shall lead men to fall prey to their price, even to the shedding of human blood.
[a] 1 Moses 16:6

30. And the widow replied saying: O thou that should quote such a law!

31. And who art thou to be so particular to regard which of these, your laws, as thou should see fit; for it is thy own greed and covetousness that shall leave me a lone widow.

32. I curse{a} thee, and thy elohim that hath no pity upon the poor and the down trodden.
[a] Hebrew masculine noun "nakh’ash," meaning "divination," "prophesying against," cursing," or "enchanting"

33. And hearing this, the judge remembered the words of the record keeper, saying: Should we save them, and raise them up in the goodness of YHVH? And he sought to hide his sin,

34. And the judge ordered the widow be put to death with her sons{w} that she not spread word{a} of his shame, and the king, Enmer Kar knew of it not.
[a] See 1 Moses 18:9-11
[w] See 2 Maccabees 7 for a similarly patterned story of a woman and her seven sons executed unjustly for religious reasons.

chapter-aka: The Twelve Righteous

1. And it came to pass that as Enmer Kar{a}, seeing that his forefather, Noah, had survived the floods{b}, desired to save his people from the flood of sin that choked the world even as a great serpent{c};
[a] See Nimrod
[b] See 1 Moses 12:29
[c] The symbol of a serpent was dual natured to the ancient Israelites, while representing fertility, life, healing, and rebirth, also represented evil power and chaos

2. And the people said one to another: Come, let us go forth; yea, let us make brick{a} and burn them thoroughly; and they had brick for stone, and they had tar for mortar.
[a] likely made by mixing bitumen (tar) with chopped straw, sand, and clay then baked in an oven

3. And the people did begin to build a temple unto YHVH{a}, that they might make sacrifices in the name of YHVH Elohim{b}.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See YHVH Elohim

4. And it came to pass that those of his people that were not converted, the children of man{a}, began again to grow in strength and began to call{b} away the children of Elohim; yet they did still continue to build the temple;
[a] See Children of man
[b] These were actively teaching rebellion, likely because of the hypocrisy and class warfare

5. But these were foolish in their thoughts, for they thought that it was the sacrifices of the temple that would save them, for they did not understand it was the chen{a} of YHVH from which salvation cometh.
[a] Chen: Hebrew (חן) "grace;" see John 1:17; Romans 3:24; Jacob 3:8 RAV, 4:7 OPV

6. And it came to pass that the people of Babel had begun to hide{a} their sins in their pride, and to focus on the feelings of their hearts, and not The Voice{b}, for they did glory in the pride of their hearts{c};
[a] See 1 Moses 17:9-11, 18:33-34
[b] See The Voice
[c] See Heart

7. And these did believe that it was their works, and their own courage that did bring them that peace and security that they did seek.

8. And so it was that the people who would be as Zion{a} did fall away by their pride, and their envy, their covetousness, and by their jealousies even to the shedding of human blood{b}.
[a] See Enoch 36:33
[b] See 1 Moses 18:34

9. And thus it was that secret combinations{a} did again creep in; for these did not their works in righteousness, but believed only upon their good feelings, and the mighty words of Enmer Kar;
[a] See 1 Moses 8

10. And so it was that these were deceived from the beginning{a}, even unto the belief that they did dwell in the last days.
[a] See 1 Moses 17:4

11. And it came to pass that the people did remember the words{a} of their forefathers, prophesying that Yachad Yachid Echad{b} should come before the last days;
[a] See Enoch 38:36
[b] Yachad Yachid Echad

12. And the people did believe that the last days were upon them, and thus it came to pass that their star gazers and astrologers went seeking signs.

13. And it came to pass that the priests and the wisemen forgot YHVH, worshiping Elohim in name only,

14. And so it was that these wise men came unto Enmer Kar telling him that he must be that Yachad Yachid Echad that should come.

15. And Enmer Kar began to boast of his own strength, and knowing that he had been in the presence of an angel he did take more than his due.

16. ¶ And it came to pass that Enmer Kar did begin to say at the first that he was Tzadik Yachad{a}, or in other words, the Yachad of that generation.
[a] See Tzadik Yachad

17. And the people looked to their king as though he were a god{a}, though he was but a man;
[a] See El, Elohim of man

18. And many were quick to speak, saying: Behold Enmer Kar, the mighty hunter! Behold the Yachad Yachid Echad that has come to redeem his people!

19. ¶ And it came to pass that these were a people living in peace, for they knew no nation mightier:

20. And because they had done their duties, these had become wise in all the wisdom of the earth; and in their wisdom they did become prideful and vain;

21. Yet these still lived in fear, for in fear alone did they do their duties, and not for the love of YHVH, nor for the love of their fellow man.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that the people remembered the words{a} of their king, Enmer Kar, saying: we have been called to build a house unto YHVH and with this key{b}, we shall open{c} the door!
[a] See 1 Moses 17:7
[b] Referring to connecting the earth and the heavens, completing the creation
[c] See Priesthood

23. And so it was that the people came before their king saying: Let us go and build us a temple, even one that should reach unto heavens, and let us make ourselves a great name upon all the earth!

24. For these understood not that the temple of YHVH should bring the heavens to the earth, and not{a} the earth to the heavens.
[a] The idea that the earth will correct and command the heavens, rather than God ruling the earth as He rules the heavens

25. And the people used their wisdom in architecture and masonry to make bricks, and to plan for and make a temple, but it was not unto YHVH but unto Amarutu{a} who is Mardochaios{a}.
[a] Another name for Mahan; see 1 Moses 7:31- 32, 8:17

26. But there were among the people twelve righteous men, and these refused to join in the building of the temple;

27. And these knew the secrets of the temple of YHVH, but they refused to give them unto the priests of Amarutu.

28. ¶ And it came to pass that these men were seized by the people, and brought before the three judges, who were high priests of Amarutu.

29. And it came to pass that the chief judge, whose name was Laadan, said unto these twelve righteous: Why for shall ye not loosen thy tongues that we might build this temple as a tower unto heaven, and the elohim{a} that has blessed us?
[a] See Elohim of man

30. For should it not be that Enmer Kar might return again to his home, and that we, his people should join him in safety there?

31. And the twelve did elect from among them one to be their voice, and his name was Tzophar{a}, and through his voice they gave their refusal.
[a] Or Zophar; "chirper" or leaper"

32. And Tzophar stood before the judges, saying: We shall not make bricks, nor remain with you, for we know but one YHVH, and Him we do serve.

33. And Laaden the judge flew into a passion of anger against the twelve righteous men and would that they be thrown into a fire, yet he desired the secrets of YHVH that he might sell{a} them.
[a] See Acts 8:18-24

34. And it came to pass that he did grant unto them seven days in prison, and at that time he would call them forth to answer him again.

35. ¶ And it came to pass that these twelve righteous men were thrown in with eleven prisoners who were strangers{a} to the land, and with these did they pray unto YHVH unto deliverance.
[a] Or refugees, those that came seeking help

36. And it came to pass that Tzophar did cry out saying: YHVH, who liveth from eternity to eternity, in whom we trust, we swear an oath unto thee that we shall not depart to walk to the right, nor to the left, save it be according to thy desire; and should we die in this place, then may it be even according to Thy will.

37. And the eleven men that had not known YHVH before that day did stand and watch in amazement.

38. ¶ And it came to pass that after seven days Laadan sent again for the twelve righteous men, and again he asked them to share their wisdom and their knowledge.

39. And it came to pass that Tzophar stood again before the judge, this time saying: We shall give thee our counsel.

40. And thus was Laadan much pleased, and he sat greedily upon his throne awaiting the words of the twelve righteous.

41. And thus it was that Tzophar spoke unto them saying: Exercise brotherly and sisterly love, for all of Adam{a} is one family; give to those that need without judgement{b}, nor to indebt, nor for reward;
[a] Adam: Hebrew, "mankind"
[b] See Mosiah 2:30-39 RAV, 4:17-23 OPV

42. Truth is the name of YHVH, for He is truth; therefore, be true in all things; go forth not rashly, neither flee in cowardice, but stand firm in YHVH;

43. Let reason be thy guide in YHVH, listening always for the Breath of Elohim{a}; give not to thy passions, but reign them and guide them that thou be true to thine heart, and not a whim of the flesh;
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

44. Do that which is right before YHVH at all times, and give unto others their due; all things ye have been given are of YHVH Elohim, and unto Him are all things due:

45. Know ye these things, forget them not, but write them upon thy heart{a}, and the words written upon thy tongue shall be pure and holy before YHVH.
[a] See Heart

46. ¶ And it came to pass that when Laadan heard these words he did grow angry at the twelve righteous men, for he understood not the Word{a} of YHVH.
[a] See Word

47. And it came to pass that he did cause that they should be put in the fire of the furnace used to bake the bricks;

48. Yet when the time came, before these could be placed into the flames, the earth shook with a great earthquake that did shake the very foundation of the lands, and tore asunder the work the people had done in building their temple.

49. And it came to pass that The Voice{a} came to the twelve righteous men, and they were told to take their families and flee to the North{b} and to the East{b},
[a] See The Voice
[b] See Cardinal directions

50. And these were not seen neither heard from again; but the eleven prisoners, these did not forget them.

chapter-aka: The Tower

1. And so it was{a} that as the people went about working on their temple, there was a great earthquake that did destroy that which they had built, even unto the very foundation.
[a] Or "and it came to pass"

2. For Michael had gone before Yah Elohim{a}, saying: Behold, the people is one, and they have all one desire; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
[a] See Yah Elohim

3. Let us then go down, and there confound their tongues{a} that they may not understand the speech of one another.
[a] Hebrew "lishshan," meaning "speech" or "language'" also refers to desires, as in communicating the same desires

4. And YHVH{a} said: Come, we shall descend and bring shame upon their lips, that they shall not listen one to another, and this shall scatter them.
[a] See YHVH

5. And YHVH went down, seeing the city and the tower which the children of men were building.

6. And YHVH said: Behold, the people are the same, and they all have the same desire and the same tongue; and this is the tower they begin to build;

7. And now, nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined, except I, YHVH, confound their tongues, that they may not understand the desires of one another.

8. And thus it shall be that I, YHVH, shall scatter them abroad from upon all the face of this land out unto every quarter of the earth.

9. And so it was that YHVH did cause that the earth should quake greatly, and with the tower destroyed their good feelings turned to bitterness and blame.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that in the confusion many of the wicked scattered, and the prisoners were freed;

11. And the few left that were righteous in the land did flee, some to the North, others to the East; but the chief architects, be they of YHVH Elohim{a} or of Mammon{b}, did flee into the land of Egypt.
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] material wealth, or those seeking worldly pleasures

12. And thus did it come to pass that the people of Babel were overtaken by the very strangers they had sought to oppress; yea, rather than accepting these as their own these strangers did become another nation from within.

13. And the people of Enmer Kar{a} had themselves become a new nation, even the nation of their pride{b}, that came unto them in great numbers, and behold the secrets of the temple were to be lost unto those of the world.
[a] See Nimrod
[b] Or "egoism"

14. And from thence did YHVH Elohim scatter them abroad, upon all the face of the land{a}, and unto every quarter of the earth{b};
[a] Or "earth"
[b] Or "land"

15. And they that remained were confounded and left off to rebuild their tower in the ruins of the old; for they hearkened not unto YHVH;

16. Wherefore, is the name of it called Babel{a} because YHVH Elohim was displeased with their works and did there confound the tongue of all the land.
[a] A play on words as in Akkadian the term is Bāb-ilim, meaning "gate of God," while in Hebrew it is bālal, "confusion," or "jumbled"

17. ¶ And it came to pass that Enmer Kar did turn his wrath towards YHVH Elohim, for his wife had been about her way laboring at the tower when it fell, and she was slain.

18. And so it was that after this Enmer Kar was given a new name, even Nimrod{a}; for he did rebel against YHVH;
[a] See Nimrod

19. And he went about the people calling himself the giver of life and death, and he who should cause the sun to rise from the east and to set again in the West.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that Nimrod did take unto himself a new wife from among this new nation, Sammur Amat; and she did become their high priestess and did lead them forth into iniquity.

21. And Sammur Amat did follow the path of Lilith{a} to become the harlot of Babylon, for she did lead her people far from their true love, YHVH Elohim:
[a] See Zenos 3:2-9

22. And she did go about saying that the last days had come, that great tribulation, and that their works had led them to over come it;

23. And the people did believe that Nimrod had done the works of Yachad Yachid Echad{a}, and was a god{b}, and did save them; and thus by their own vanities did they deceive themselves.
[a] See Yachad Yachid Echad
[b] El: Hebrew, "god" 

24. And the people of Babel in the land of Shinar did build again on top of the temple destroyed by YHVH, and Nimrod and Sammur Amat did take peace from the land, demanding tribute and making war against their neighbors.

25. And the people cried unto the heavens, but Raphael{a} would not come to heal the land, for these had rejected YHVH Elohim.

1. These were the generations of Shem: And Shem begat Arphaxad two years after the flood; and Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad to bring forth many sons and daughters.

2. And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Arphaxad begat other sons and daughters.

3. And Salah begat Eber; and after he begat Eber he begat other sons and daughters.

4. And Eber begat Peleg; and after he begat Peleg he begat other sons and daughters.

5. And Peleg begat Reu and he begat other sons and daughters.

6. And Reu begat Serug; and after he begat Serug he begat many sons and daughters.

7. And Serug begat Nahor and other sons and daughters.

8. And Nahor begat Terah{a}; and after he begat Terah he begat other sons and daughters.
[a] Hebrew, Terach; "Wanderer"

9. And Terah begat Abram{a}, Nahor, and Haran.
[a] Hebrew, "exalted father"

10. And now these were the generations of Terah: Terah begat Haran, Nahor, and Abram; and Haran begat Lot{a}.
[a] "Hidden" or "Veiled"

11. And Nahor and Abram took them wives;

12. And the name of the wife of Nahor was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah;

13. And the name of the wife of Abram was Sarai{a}, but Sarai was barren, and she bare no child.
[a] Hebrew, Sarai; "princess"

14. Now Terah was an idolater{a} and he did make idols with his hands and did sell them as they traveled;
[a] One who who makes and/or worships idols

15. But Abram remembered YHVH Elohim{a} that did save his forefathers from the flood, and desired to serve YHVH{b} alone.
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] See YHVH

16. ¶ And it came to pass that there was a famine in the land, and Haran died before his father, Terah, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

17. And it came to pass that Terah did speak unto Abram saying: When thou shall see death come upon me what shall thou worship after I am gone?

18. And Abram replied, saying: We shall worship YHVH Elohim, the Elohim{a} of our fathers, for YHVH is our Elohim, and we devote ourselves to Him.
[a] See Elohim

19. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram would not bow before the elohim{a} that his father made, nor would he bow to the kings of the earth, for he saw these as works of the Creator and unworthy of worship.
[a] Hebrew, "gods;" here referring to idols; see Elohim of man

20. And Terah was angry and said unto Abram: What of these elohim that have blessed us?

21. And Abram answered him saying: These elohim have not blessed us, but we have blessed them! For these are thy creation, and the wealth they grant us is not for our labors nor for their love of us.

22. Behold, thy idols of wood, that they do burn and protect themselves not; fire may burn these, yet we may subdue the fire;

23. And they that thou hast cut from stone, these sink to the bottoms of the waters and can not save themselves; yet we may cut into the earth and change the very course of the waters; therefore are we not greater than thy elohim?

24. Yea, and I will not call these YHVH, for the fire and the waters subside them and they are subject to us.

25. More worthy of worship is the sun, for with it illuminates the whole of this creation and brings life from its warmth;

26. Yet the sun also I shall not worship, nor will I place amongst Ha'Elohim{a} the moon or the stars, for these must hide themselves and at times dim their lights.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

27. Hear, O my father, I shall seek before thee Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh{a} who created{b} all the Elohim:
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh
[b] See 1 Moses 3:3

28. For behold, who else was it but YHVH who made{a} the heavens, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars?
[a] See John 1:10; 3 Nephi 4:44 RAV, 9:15a OPV

29. Who else but YHVH is it that has dried the earth in the midst of the many waters?

30. Yea, and who but YHVH is it that has caused me to seek Him out, who but Elohim shall reveal Himself by Himself?

31. And it came to pass that Terah began to plot at this time against his son.

1. And it came to pass that in the land of Egypt{a} those that had followed Nimrod{b} but had escaped the tower{c} did rule over the lands.
[a] Egypt can represent the world, or worldliness; the desire to receive for one’s self
[b] See 1 Moses 20
[c] See 1 Moses 20:14

2. And it came to pass that when they in the land of Chaldea did hear Abram speaking highly of YHVH{a} these did fear, and they did cause that he should be taken;
[a] See YHVH

3. And these wicked priests of Pharaoh that were about in the land did grab all they that would not bow down before the elohim of Pharaoh{a}.
[a] "Pharaoh" can represent our conscience or worldly thoughts or desires; see Pharaoh

4. And the priests of Pharaoh did cause that he, Abram, should be put to death;

5. And these did lay him upon the altar of their elohim{a}, for they did fear that their elohim did destroy the tower, and Terah did not prevent{b} them.
[a] See Elohim of man
[b] Or "Terah did not try to stop the priests of Pharaoh"

6. And there upon the altar The Voice{a} of YHVH came down from the heavens as a stream of fire, calling out: Abram, Abram!
[a] See The Voice

7. And Abram said: Here am I!

8. And The Voice said: Thou art searching for the Elohim of elohim{a}, the Creator{b}, the understanding of thy heart{c}: behold! I am He.
[a] Hebrew: "the God of gods," or "the Gods over the gods," or "God(s) over the council of gods"
[b] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh
[c] This statement is referring to the idea that Abram knew God from the inside out, knowing without knowing how he knew; an understanding, the balance between knowledge and wisdom; see The Heart

9. And the angel of YHVH{a} did come and take him, calling him by name, saying: Hear O Abram, and behold the strength of YHVH!
[a] See Angel of YHVH

10. And I have heard thee, and have come down to deliver thee, and to take thee away from the house of thy father, and from all thy kinsfolk, into a strange land which thou knowest not of;

11. And this because these have turned their hearts away from me, to worship the elohim{a} of their hands, and the elohim of Pharaoh;
[a] Hebrew, "gods;" here referring to idols

12. Therefore, I have come down to visit them, and to destroy these that hath lifted up their hand against thee to take away thy life.

13. Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will take thee in, and seal upon thee my name, even as I did thy fathers; and my power shall be over thee, and I shall be with thee;

14. Therefore, Abram, get thee out of this land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee;

15. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing;

16. And I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee; and in thee shall the families of the earth be blessed.

17. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH did teardown the altars of the elohim{a} of that land, utterly destroying them, and He did smite the priests that they died;
[a] Hebrew, "gods;" here referring to idols

18. And so it was that there was great mourning in Chaldea, and word was sent unto the court of Pharaoh, and these too did grieve, but they knew not of the hand of YHVH nor of Abram.

19. And was so great the faith of Abram that upon that day he did rise to the seventy-fifth degree.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram and Sarai, his wife, and Lot, the son of Haran, his brother's son, and Advu, the wife of Lot, and went forth from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan; and Terah tarried with them.

21. And so it was that they did come unto Haran and they did dwelt there.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that the famine{a} debated, and that Terah did not find teshuvah{b}, but continue to worship the elohim{c} of his hands; or in other words, the elohim of his own creation.
[a] Double meaning, lack of physical and spiritual nourishment
[b] See Teshuvah
[c] Hebrew, "gods;" here referring to idols

23. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram, and Lot, his nephew, did pray unto YHVH, and the angel of YHVH did appear unto them,

24. And the angel of YHVH said unto Abram: Arise, and take Lot with thee; for my own purposes do I take thee away out of Haran,

25. And I shall make thee my Sharath{a} and my Ro’eh{b} to bear my name in a strange land which I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when they shall hearken unto my Voice{c}:
[a] Hebrew: "servant" or "minister"
[b] Hebrew: "shepherd"
[c] See The Voice

26. For I am YHVH, thy Elohim; I dwell in the heavens; the earth is my footstool; my name is YHVH, and I know the end from the beginning; therefore, my hand shall be over thee.

27. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations,

28. And thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that by their hands shall my Voice be heard in all nations;

29. And through thy name I shall bless them; for as many as receive the news of this message shall be called after thy name{a}, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father.
[a] See Book of Remembrance 42:1

30. And I shall give thee power to seal{a} on earth unto heaven, and to bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee;
[a] See Doctrines of the Saints 1:11, 17a:72, 17c:3- 16. 17d:26, 42:42, and 119:16

31. And in thee and in thy seed I give unto thee a promise: that this right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of eternal life.

32. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram departed, as YHVH had spoken unto him; and Lot desired to attend him.

33. And Abram took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and Lot’s wife, Advu, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had received in Haran;

34. And they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

35. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem and the plain of Moreh; and the Canaanites were then in the land.

36. And YHVH came unto Abram and said: Unto thy seed will I give this land.

37. And there he did build an altar unto YHVH, who had appeared unto him.

38. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, leaving Bethel on the West; and Hai was on the East;

39. And there too he built an altar unto YHVH and called upon the name of YHVH; and Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South{a}.

1. And it came to pass that there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt{a} to sojourn there, for the famine had become most grievous in the land.
[a] See Egypt

2. And it came to pass that as Abram journeyed towards Egypt as they came near to enter into that land, YHVH{a} came unto Abram{b} saying: Behold, Sarai, thy wife, is a very fair woman to look upon;
[a] See YHVH
[b] Abram and Sarai: Here representing a level or degree of our desire to bestow (Abram) and our will to receive (Sarai); these are righteous, reaching at least the 75th degree (see 1 Moses 22:16) but have not yet been born again as Abraham and Sarah

3. Therefore, it shall come to pass that when the Egyptians{a} shall see her, they will say: She is his wife; and they will slay thee, that they might have her, yet these shall save her alive;
[a] Representing here our selfish desires

4. Therefore, see that ye do on this wise: Thou shall speak unto her, that she shall say unto the Egyptians that she is thy sister, and thy soul shall live; and this ye shall do for a wise purpose unto me.

5. And YHVH Elohim{a} showed{b} unto him the urim and thummim{c}, stretching out His divine hand, and shewed unto Abram many things; yea even many marvels;
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] Or "showed him how to make," or "showed how to use"
[c] Hebrew "Lights and Perfections;" see Urim and Thummim

6. And Abram was shown{a} the sun, the moon, the stars, and their places and their purpose in the heavens; for these do show unto man the stories of the past and are given for signs and seasons; for omens and wonders.
[a] See See Abraham 3 in the CLCLdS Pearl of Great Price

7. And the angel of YHVH{a} did say unto the man{b}: the night that thou wast born the stars rained in the sky, and four stars took flight to one another to cause a great light, and this to know that mine servant was born into the world.
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] Adam: Hebrew, "mankind;" here "man" 

8. And Abram did look into the urim and thummim and did behold many things that came to pass before the world was, and many things that should come, and he did marvel.

9. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram told Sarai all that YHVH had shown unto him.

10. And after this he said unto her: Behold, now I know thee to be a fair woman to look upon;

11. Therefore, it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say: This is his wife; and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive;

12. Say then, I pray thee, unto them: I am his sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and my soul shall live because of thee; and this I ask for a wise purpose unto YHVH.

13. ¶ And it came to pass that when Abram and Sarai and their people did come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman, Sarai, that she was very fair.

14. And the princes{a} of the court of Pharaoh also saw her and commanded her to be brought before Pharaoh; and Sarai was taken into the house of Pharaoh.
[a] Representing the eating worldly desires, lust and consumption

15. And Pharaoh did entreat Abram well for her sake{a}; and he was given sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
[a] Pharaoh want to buy Sarai as property, not realizing this is God’s will; an attempt to bring Pharaoh to the upper world of righteous desires

16. And he{a} did give Abram a place that he might have the ear of Pharaoh, and Abram did teach many things unto Pharaoh, for YHVH Elohim had instructed him so;
[a] Pharaoh

17. And Abram did show unto Pharaoh the sky and its secrets, and he did teach Pharaoh of YHVH, and Pharaoh was pleased with what he was shown of Abram.

18. ¶ And it came to pass that the elohim{a} of that land did send plagues unto Pharaoh and his house from the day that Pharaoh knew{b} Sarai, even great plagues because of Sarai, the wife of Abram and Pharaoh.
[a] See Elohim of man
[b] Pharaoh and Sarai consummated their relationship, making the marriage legal and binding, making Sarai truly a queen over Egypt

19. And Pharaoh called Abram to stand before him, saying: What hast thou done unto me in this thing?

20. And Abram did confess that which he had done, saying that this was a wise purpose unto YHVH Elohim.

21. But Pharaoh feared his own elohim, and not YHVH Elohim, saying: Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? Why sayest thou: She is my sister?

22. Yea, and didst thou do this that I might have taken her unto me to wife? And now she has lain with two men, and is taking hold of two men, as if I, Pharaoh, would be her concubine.

23. And now the law has been made, but shall not be fulfilled{a}, else our wives{b} shall fall prey to ideas{c}.
[a] Pharaoh is not rejecting the his marriage Sarai but is rejecting her by sending her back to the higher desire that is Abram
[b] Egyptian women, these can represent our worldly or greedy desires to receive
[c] Or "will think they can control us;" our desires to receive can control us,:as an addiction; may also refer to a past matriarchal ruling class and a fear of returning to a matriarchy

24. Now therefore, behold, I say unto thee: Take thy wife and go thy way.

25. And Pharaoh commanded men{a} concerning him; and they sent Abram away, and Sarai, and all that they had.
[a] The desires of Pharaoh and Egypt overpower the righteous desires of Abram and Sarai, they are sent away to grow stronger

26. And Abram and Sarai went up out of Egypt taking all that they had, and Lot and his wife with them, unto the South{a}.

1. And now it was even as YHVH{a} had promised; for Abram and Sarai{b} were very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
[a] See YHVH
[b] Our desire to bestow and our will to receive; see 1 Moses 23:2

2. And they went on their journey from the south, even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai, unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first; and there Abram called on the name of YHVH.

3. And Lot and Advu, his wife, also went with Abram, and they too had an abundance of flocks, and herds, and tents;

4. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together; for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.

5. And there was strife between the herdsmen of the cattle of Abram and the herdsmen of the cattle of Lot, that they could not dwell together.

6. And Abram said unto Lot: Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren:

7. Therefore, separate thyself, I pray thee, from me; if thou go to the left hand, then I will go to the right; if thou go to the right hand, then I will go to the left, for is not the whole land before us?

8. And so, let us then call upon YHVH for instructions on wither we should go.

9. ¶ And it came to pass that they did call upon YHVH, and they did listen to The Voice{a} which said: Abram, send thee my servant Lot into the lands of Sodom and Gomorrah, to offer them teshuvah{b} that they might cease their lustful and violent works{c} unto their destruction.
[a] See The Voice
[b] See Teshuvah
[c] See Ezekiel 16:49-50

10. And this was said for the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land, and these knew not YHVH.

11. And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere before YHVH destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like as the garden of Eden, yea even as the land of Egypt.

12. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan, as he had been told, and Lot and Advu journeyed East{a}; and they did separate themselves the one from the other.
[a] Kedem: East represents the past, knowledge, God the Father (the Divine Masculine); refers here to Lot and Advu seeking knowledge and experience

13. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom that he and his wife might learn of them and teach them of YHVH and His teshuvah.

14. But the desires of Sodom were exceedingly wicked before YHVH, and YHVH was angry with them.

15. And YHVH said unto Abram after Lot was separated from him: Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, Northward, and South-ward, and Eastward, and Westward{a};
[a] See Cardinal directions

16. And remember the covenant which I will make with thee; for it shall be a new and everlasting covenant{a}; and thou shalt remember the days of Enoch, thy father;
[a] A covenant written and sealed upon our hearts, binding the earth and heaven to bring the heavens to the earth; the sealing power

17. For all the land which thou seest I give thee and to thy seed forever; and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man{a} can number the dust of the earth, thy seed shall also be numbered.
[a] Adam: Hebrew, "man," or "mankind"

18. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.

19. Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the oaks of Mamre, which was in Hebron, and built there an altar unto YHVH.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram journeyed from thence toward the South country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

21. And Abram said again of Sarai, his wife: She is my sister; and so it was that Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for and took Sarai.

22. And it came to pass that the elohim{a} of Abimelech came to him in a dream by night and said unto him: Behold, thou hast taken a woman which already has many husbands, for she is the wife of Abram, and they have done this before.
[a] Hebrew, "gods;" here lesser or false gods, or base desires; see 1 Moses 23:18

23. And Abimelech awoke, saying: I shalt return her unto Abram; for if I do it not, and should I die{a} Abram shall sit upon my throne!
[a] This fear is not from God

24. Therefore, Abimelech arose early in the morning, and called his servants, and told them all these things in the secret of their confidence; and the men were sore afraid.

25. And Abimelech did call Abram before him the next day and said: Wilt thou slay me to take unto thyself this righteous nation?

26. What hast thou done unto us? And in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done things unto me that ought not to be done.

27. What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? Behold, didst thou not say unto me: She is my sister? And she, even she herself, said: He is my brother!

28. And by her beauty and the integrity of my heart{a} and innocence of my hands have I done this thing.
[a] See Heart

29. And Abram said unto him: Yea, I know that thou didst do this in the integrity of thy heart, for I am a prophet{a}; and I shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live;
[a] An intermediary between God and mankind

30. For I seek not thy throne that thou should surely die, thou and all that thou hath are thine, all but Sarai which is also mine.

31. And we have done this thing because I thought assuredly the fear of Elohim Shaddai{a} was not in this place and they would slay me for the sake of my wife, and this we did also for a wise purpose in YHVH{b};
[a] Hebrew, "the Almighty God;" see Elohim Shaddai
[b] See 1 Moses 23:4

32. And yet, indeed, she is my sister; the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

33. And it came to pass, when Elohim{a} caused me to wander from the house of my father, that I said unto her: This shall be thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me: At every place whither we shall come, say of me: He is my brother; and this we did for a wise purpose in YHVH.
[a] See Elohim 

34. And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men servants and women servants, and gave unto Abram, and also gave unto him Sarai, their wife.

35. And Abimelech said unto him: Behold, my land lies before thee; dwell wherever it pleaseth thee; but speak not again of these matters that this law{a} be forgotten.
[a] Allowing women to take multiple husbands

36. And unto Sarai he said: Behold, I have given thy brother{a} a thousand pieces of silver; and he shall give unto thee a covering for thy eyes, and it shall be a token{b} unto all that thou mayest not be taken again from Abram, thy husband.
[a] Here, Abimelech is mocking Sarah
[b] Or "a sign;" Abimelech is telling Sarah to hide her beauty with a hijab, a veil worn by women in the presence of men outside their immediate family which covers the head and chest

37. And this he said in anger, that she be reproved, for he understood not the will of YHVH Elohim{a}.
[a] See YHVH Elohim

38. ¶ And it came to pass that Abram prayed unto Yah{a}; and YHVH healed Abimelech, and his wives, and his maid-servants, and they bare unto him children;
[a] See Yah

39. For until that day YHVH had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech that upon seeing the power of YHVH given Abram he might know the true Elohim,

40. But feeling slighted his eyes remained shut tight, peering with his heart only to see that he be not deceived by Abram and Sarai again.

1. And it came to pass, in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar, and Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of nations, that these kings made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela;

2. All these, even Bera, Birsha, Shinab, Shemeber, and the king of Bela were joined together, united in a secret oath of priestcraft{a}, in the valley of Siddim, which is at the salt sea;
[a] See 1 Moses 7:29- 30; see also Priestcraft

3. For twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year these did rebel against him.

4. And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashtoreth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, and the Horites in their Mount Seir, unto Elparan, which was by the wilderness.

5. And they returned and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites and also the Amorites in Hazezontamar.

6. ¶ And from there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela;

7. And these joined battle with them in the valley of Siddim; with Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and with Tidal, king of nations, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar—four kings against five.

8. And the valley of Siddim was filled with slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there; but they that remained fled to the hill country, and to the mountains.

9. And it came to pass that the four kings did seize all the goods, taking all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food and provisions and went their way.

10. And they took Lot, the nephew of Abram, and Advu, Lot’s wife, for they did dwell in Sodom; and they took them and their goods and departed.

11. ¶ And there came one that had escaped and told Abram, the Hebrew, the man of YHVH{a}; for he dwelt in the land of the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eschol and brother of Aner; and these were bound by a treaty with Abram.
[a] See YHVH

12. And when Abram heard that Lot and Advu and their people were taken captive, he armed three hundred and eighteen of his trained men, and all these were born in his own house, and pursued unto Dan.

13. And he came unto them by night, and divided himself against them, he and his men, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which was on the left hand of Damascus.

14. And he brought back Lot, his brother's son, Advu, Lot’s wife, and all their goods, and the women also, and the people.

15. And the king of Sodom also went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which was the dale of the king.

16. And Melchizedek, king of Salem{a}, brought forth bread and wine; and he did brake the bread and blessed it; and he blessed the wine, he being the High Priest of El Elyon{b}.
[a] "King or Peace;" see Book of Melchizedek
[b] The Most High God, or the highest God, or the highest of the gods.

17. And he gave to Abram, and he blessed him, saying: Abram, thou art blessed, for thou art a man of El Elyon, possessor of heaven and of earth;

18. And blessed is the name of El Elyon, which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand.

19. And thus Abram gave unto Melchizedek in tithes from all he had taken, to care for the poor and the needy in and about the land.

20. And the king of Sodom said to Abram: Give me the persons and take the goods to thyself.

21. But Abram said to the king of Sodom: I have lifted up my hand unto YHVH, the El Elyon, the Creator{a}: the possessor of heaven and earth,
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

22. And I have sworn an oath that I will not take of thee from a thread even to a shoe latchet and that I will not take anything that is thine, lest thou should say: I have made Abram rich,

23. Yea, I shall take of thee nothing, save only that which the young men have eaten; but unto the men which went with me, Aner, Eschol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

24. ¶ And it came to pass that Melchizedek lifted up his voice and blessed Abram, he being the High Priest and the keeper of the storehouse of Yah{a}, appointed to receive tithes for the poor.
[a] See Yah

25. ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol, the chief captain of his host, spake unto Abram, saying: Ha'Elohim{a} is with thee in all that thou doest!
[a] See Ha'Elohim

26. Now, therefore, swear unto me here that, by the help of El Elyon, thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son; but that, according to the kindness that I have shown unto thee, thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

27. And Abram said unto him: I will swear.

28. And then Abram reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which the servants of Abimelech had violently taken away.

29. And Abimelech said: Thou didst not tell me; and I know not who hath done this thing; neither yet have I heard that it was done until this day.

30. And Abram took sheep and oxen and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.

31. And Abram set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

32. And Abimelech said unto Abram: What wilt thou do with these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

33. And he said: Seven ewe lambs shalt thou take at my hand, that they may be a witness unto me that I have digged this well.

34. And because we shall swear, both of us, wherefore the name of that place will be Bearsheba;

35. And thus they made a covenant.

36. Then Abimelech and Phicol, the chief captain of his hosts, rose up, and he sent men to plant a grove in Bearsheba, and to call there on the name of YHVH; and then to returned unto their lands.

37. And it came to pass that Abram did worship El’olam{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "the Everlasting God"

chapter-aka: The Blessings

1. And it came to pass that Abram took his things, and his people, and departed back towards his own lands.

2. And it came to pass that in his journeys the Word of YHVH{a} came unto Abram in a vision, saying: Fear not, Abram; for I shall be thy shield;
[a] See YHVH 

3. And I will be thy exceedingly great reward, even according to the blessings of my servant, Melchizedek{a}, I will give unto thee.
[a] Hebrew: "King of Peace," see 1 Moses 25:24, Book of Melchizedek

4. And Abram said: YHVH Elohim{a}, what wilt thou give me, seeing I and Sarai, my wife, go childless?
[a] See YHVH Elohim 

5. For Eliezer of Damascus was made to be the heir of my house and all that I possess; and because thou hast given us no seed, one born as a servant in my house is mine heir.

6. And behold, the word of YHVH came unto Abram again, saying: This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

7. And YHVH Elohim brought him forth abroad and said: Look now toward the heavens and count the stars, if thou be able to number them; I say unto thee, even so shall thy seed be.

8. And Abram believed YHVH, and it was credited to him as righteousness; and he said: YHVH Elohim, how wilt thou give me this land for an everlasting inheritance?

9. And YHVH reminded Abram of the visions given him in the urim and thummim{a}, saying: I, YHVH, brought thee out{b} of Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it;
[a] See 1 Moses 23:5; Urim and Thummim
[b] See 1 Moses 22:10

10. And though thou wast as dead, yet am I not able to give it thee? And if thou shalt die, yet shalt thy seed possess it.

11. Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

12. ¶ And after this vision had left him, Abram took unto him all these, and he cut them, dividing them in the midst, and he laid each piece one against the other; but the birds he did not divide.

13. And he did burn them upon the altar, and those that were with him did eat; but when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away, and that which was not eaten continued to burn and to smoke.

14. ¶ And when the sun was going down, it came to pass that a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a great terror and darkness fell upon him.

15. And YHVH spake, and awoke Abram back to the vision, saying: Abram, thou shalt die and go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried at a good old age;

16. Know of a surety that after this, thy seed shall be a stranger in a land in which they shall serve the strangers{a}, and they shall be afflicted and serve them four hundred years.
[a] See 2 Moses 18, 3 Moses 1

17. And know also that this nation whom they shall serve will I judge; and afterwards shall they come out with great substance; but in the fourth generation they shall turn back to come hither again.

18. And the vision left him again, and Abram began again to sleep.

19. ¶ And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp remained in the midst of those pieces which Abram had divided.

20. And it came to pass that Abram awoke from his sleep and looked forth into that light that shined in the darkness{a} and saw the days of the Son of Man and was glad; and his soul found rest.
[a] The fire was used for divination; the burning fire was a light in the darkness, just as Jesus Christ is a light in the darkness

21. And Abram remembered all that YHVH had shown him in the urim and thummim saying: I have found the Shalom of YHVH{a}, for the day cometh that the Son of Man{b} shall live:
[a] "Peace of God," or  "Peace of YHVH"
[b] Hebrew: "Ben Adam," here a name for Jesus Christ

22. Yet how can He live if He is not born of a woman that He might die and take up his life again?

23. He must first be quickened; and even so, through Him shall I and my seed be quickened, and shall live.

24. And in that same day YHVH made an Everlasting Covenant{a} with Abram, saying: Unto thy seed have I given this land:
[a] See Everlasting covenant

25. From the river of Egypt unto the great river Euphrates, and from the land the Kenites, and the Kenazites, and the Kadmonites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

26. ¶ And it came to pass that in the morning Abram returned home in peace.

27. Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had born them no sons; yet she had with her an Egyptian woman, a princess, even a daughter of Pharaoh, she being given of Pharaoh unto Sarai, who was called Hagar{a}.
[a] Hebrew. "stranger;" based on the text, the impression is given that Hagar is Sarai’s daughter, or Sarai adopted Hagar, taking in one of Pharaoh’s daughters as her own; what is clear is that Hagar was not a servant nor a slave owned by Sarai

28. And it came to pass that after hearing all that YHVH had said unto Abram, Sarai said unto her husband: Behold now, YHVH hath closed me up from bearing thee seed;

29. I pray thee, go in unto this woman with me from Egypt, and take her also as thy wife, for she is worthy by her birthright; and do this that perhaps we may obtain children by her.

30. And Abram hearkened unto the voice of Sarai, his wife; for even so had she hearkened unto him in gaining two husbands whilst they were in Egypt.

31. And Sarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar, the Egyptian woman, and gave her to her husband, Abram, to be his wife, sealing them together in the covenant of YHVH{a}.
[a] representing the marriage covenant, sealing Abram, Sarai, and Hagar as one in YHVH

32. And Abram went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, Hagar began to look upon herself with much pride of heart, and began to despise their wife, Sarai, seeing her as lesser in her eyes;

33. For it was that she, Hagar, thought that she should give Abram a son, and that her child should rule when Abram was taken in death.

34. And Sarai said unto Abram: I have made a grave mistake; I have given this woman from Egypt{a} into thy bosom,
[a] See Egypt

35. And when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes for she now sees herself as above me in her station: YHVH judge between me and thee.

36. But Abram said unto Sarai: Behold, this, our wife, is in thy hands; and we have made a covenant between she and us and YHVH; wherefore, we cannot send her away,

37. And now she is thy equal in our bond, and no servant to be beneath thee; therefore, fix this thing between she and thee; and I place this firmly in thy hands.

38. But Sarai was sorrowed by the words of their husband and she listened not, and she dealt harshly with Hagar; and so great was her affliction that she fled from before the face of Sarai.

39. And an angel of YHVH{a}, being named Barlechi{b}, found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur,
[a] a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH, not the angel of YHVH
[b] Hebrew, "source of living water"

40. And Barlechi said unto her: Hagar, from hence comest thou, and whither wilt thou go?

41. And Hagar answered: I flee from the face of my lady, Sarai.

42. And Barlechi said unto her: Return to thy lady and submit thyself unto her hands; for YHVH will multiply thy seed exceedingly, so that it shall not be numbered for multitude:

43. Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shall call his name Ishmael{a} because YHVH hath heard thy afflictions;
[a] Hebrew: Yishmael, "God hears"

44. And he will be a wild{a} man; and his hand will be against every man, and the hand of every man against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
[a] Or "untameable;" Ishmael's descendants become the Arabic people a people at odds with the Jewish people for millennia

45. And Hagar asked the name of this angel of YHVH.

46. And Barlechi spake unto her, saying: Knowest thou that Ha'Elohim{a} seest thee?
[a] See Ha'Elohim 

47. And she said: I know that thou art sent from El Roi{a}, for YHVH, the Elohim{b} of my husband and all his house, has seen me;
[a] Hebrew, "The God who sees me"
[b] See Elohim

48. And I have also here looked and seen; and truly in this place have I seen one who looks after me.

49. And there was a well between Kadesh and Bered near where Hagar saw the angel, wherefore, the well was called Bearlahai’roir{a} after this angel of YHVH, for a memorial to the seed of Abram.
[a] Hebrew, "To look or to see, the living one who sees, or miraculous"

50. ¶ And it came to pass that Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram and Hagar did call their son's name Ishmael, by the words of Barlechi, the angel.

51. And Abram had reached the eighty-sixth degree and Sarai the eighty-third when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.

chapter-aka: The Covenant of Circumcision

1. And it came to pass that YHVH Elohim{a} did bless Abram, and Sarai, and Hagar, and did give unto them riches, and honor, and lands for an ever-lasting possession, according to the covenant{b} which had been made, and according to the blessing wherewith Melchizedek{c} had blessed Abram.

[b] Hebrew, "Berith;" an alliance or treaty, here a divine constitution or ordinance with signs or pledges
[c] Hebrew, "King or Peace;" see 1 Moses 25:24, Book of Melchizedek

2. And when Abram had reached the ninety-ninth degree, and Sarai had reached the ninety-eighth degree, it came to pass that the High Priest, Melchizedek, took Abram and Sarai and did teach them all he knew of YHVH Elohim, that Abram and Sarai might possess hidden{a} wisdom unto YHVH{b}.
[a] See Book of Remembrance 15:18-19
[b] See YHVH

3. But their wife, Hagar, he did not teach; for she would not cease to worship the elohim{a} of her old land, even the gods{a} of the hands of man.
[a] Hebrew, "gods;" here referring to the gods of Egypt; see Elohim of man

4. And it came to pass that in that day, that YHVH spoke unto Abram and Sarai, saying: I am Elohim Shaddai{a}, and thou shalt come before my Face{b} uprightly and be complete{c} before me;
[a] See Elohim Shaddai
[b] See Shekinah
[c] Hebrew: "Complete," "blameless," "whole," or "intact." See Matthew 5:43-48, 9:12; Enos 1:10-11 RAV, 1:8 OPV; 3 Nephi 5:89-92 RAV, 12:43-48 OPV

5. And through my servant, Melchizedek, I will make my covenant{a} between me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly.
[a] See Covenant

6. And YHVH Elohim spoke to Abram through His servant, Melchizedek, as he prayed over him, blessing him, saying: My people have gone astray from my precepts and have not kept mine ordinances{a}, which I gave unto their fathers;
[a] Melchizedek is blessing Abram before giving him the Endowments

7. And they have not observed mine anointing{a}, and the tvilah{b} wherewith I appointed{c} them in teshuvah{d},
[a] Hebrew, "to consecrate a portion"
[b] Hebrew, "washing;" a ritual washing, full body immersion in "living water," for ablution, similar to baptism
[c] Hebrew, "Invite," or "instruct explicitly;" "to lay charge upon," "give charge" to, "command," or "order."
[d] See Teshuvah 

8. But these have turned from this, my mitzvoth{a}, and taken unto themselves the washing of children, the burning of flesh unto ash, and the sprinkling of blood.
[a] Mitzvah: Hebrew, calling, commandment, or religious duty

9. But as for thee, behold, I will make my covenant with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations;

10. And this covenant I will make with thy children that it may be known among all nations.

11. And thy name shall no more be called Abram, but I shall give thee and new name, and thy wife Sarai also:

12. And thy name shall be called Abraham{a}; for a father of many nations have I made thee:
[a] Hebrew, "exalted father"

13. And I shall make thee exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come of thee and of thy seed.

14. And I will establish a covenant with thee with the circumcision of the heart{a}, and it shall be my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
[a] Hebrew: "circumcise the foreskin your heart;" God is asking for a broken or cut heart; see 3 Nephi 4:49 RAV, 9:20 OPV; see Heart

15. And thou mayest know of a surety forever that children are not accountable before me until they are of age, for a babe cannot walk, nor child comprehend the weightier matters.

16. But as for thee, thou shalt walk in teshuvah, observing to keep my Law and all my covenants wherein I covenanted with thy fathers, and thou shalt teach thy children the same;

17. And thou shalt keep the mitzvoth which I have given thee with mine own mouth and I shall be thy Elohim{a} and the Elohim of thy seed after thee.
[a] See Elohim

18. And I will give unto thee and thy seed after thee a land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, for so long as they shall know and keep their Elohim;

19. Therefore, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee in their generations.

20. And this shall be my covenant which ye shall keep between me and thee and thy seed after thee: Every child among you shall be taught to become circumcised{a};
[a] See 1 Moses 27:14; 3 Nephi 4:49 RAV, 9:20 OPV

21. And when every child is eight days old, they shall be blessed and instructed in teshuvah, that they may be circumcised{a} of the heart when they come of age— yea, every child forever in all generations:
[a] The Covenant of Christ that we all make in every generation from the beginning to the end of time; see New and Everlasting Covenant

22. They that are born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed:

23. They that are born in thy house and they that are bought with thy money must needs be taught, and my covenant shall be even woven into thy skin for a new and everlasting covenant{a};
[a] See New and Everlasting Covenant

24. And when thy children come of age, they shall be given the token of the covenant between me and thee;

25. And the uncircumcised, they who shall not circumcise their hearts, these souls shall be spiritually{a} cut off from the people and shall not learn my signs and tokens; for these hath broken my covenant.
[a] The original text implies that they will be cut off by not being taught the or given the proper ordinances, this word was added by inspiration to clarify

26. And Melchizedek said these and many other words unto Abram; and after this, Melchizedek came unto Sarai, Abraham’s wife, and he blessed her, saying: Sarai, thou shalt no longer be called Sarai, but Sarah{a} shall be thy new name.
[a] Hebrew: "princess" or "Elect Lady"

27. And I will bless thee, and YHVH will give thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him also, even the new and everlasting covenant with his seed after him.

28. Yea, I will bless thee, and thou shall be blessed, for thou shall be known as the mother of nations; kings and queens and many people shall come out of thee;

29. And as thou art a queen over Egypt{a}, and other lands, thy seed shall be a royal people;
[a] Here representing the earth while Abraham represents the heavens, their marriage uniting heavens and earth; see Egypt

30. And because thou art a Priestess, and thy husband a Priest, thy children with him shall be a royal priesthood, given them by the Law of the Patriarchal and Matriarchal{a} priesthood established by the covenant, that shall be passed down by the blood through thy seed unto the ends of the earth.
[a] See Doctrines of the Saints 119:22-29

31. And it shall be through thy seed who shall have claim over the earth through Egypt and the heavens through my Priesthood that the heavens shall be brought unto the earth in tikkun olam{a}; that the creation shall be completed:
[a] The original text of the plates of brass speak of healing and completing the creation. The diviner/translator used this term as it equates to these in a simpler term; a more literal translation would be: "…that the heavens shall be brought unto the earth in healing completion; that the creation shall be eternally finished;" see Tikkun olam

32. Therefore, I give thee thy duty to teach these things unto thy children that when they come of age their walk shall be in teshuvah with me, and their hearts shall be circumcised;

33. And when they do come of age, they that shall not reject the covenant but shall be my covenant people, unto these shalt thou give my signs and tokens, even as I did give them unto thy ancestors{a}.
[a] Literally "forefathers;" see the Book of Remembrance

34. And Sarah wondered in her heart: How should this be? For she was barren.

35. And Abraham did fall on his face and called upon the name of YHVH, and rejoiced, and said in his heart: There shall a child be born unto me and Sarah, though she is barren of me, she shall still conceive.

36. And Melchizedek said: Sarah, thy wife, shall bear thee a son, and it shall be as YHVH has spoken.

37. And Abraham said unto YHVH before Melchizedek: O, that Ishmael might live uprightly before YHVH Elohim!

38. And Melchizedek answered him in the spirit of prophecy and revelation, saying: As for Ishmael, Elohim hath heard thee;

39. Behold, he shall be blessed, and YHVH will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and Elohim will make him a great nation.

40. But this covenant will be establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year, unless Ishmael{a} and his seed should come to El Elyon{b} through Isaac, for they too shall be of thy seed.
[a] "Ismael" originally "Isaac" in the text, this changed after prayer by inspiration 
[b] Hebrew, " The Most High God," or "the highest God," or "the highest of the gods"

41. And Melchizedek gave unto Abraham and Sarah all that had been passed down from Adam{a} and Eve{b} from the beginning, even the keys, and the signs, and the tokens.
[a] Adam: Hebrew for mankind, here referring both to the man Adam and to all the patriarchs and prophets from Adam and Eve to that day; this is saying the Melchizedek had and gave them all the keys of the priesthood for all generations
[b] Eve was implied and added to the text per revelation

42. And it came to pass that after this, Melchizedek left off talking with them; and Elohim went up from Abraham and Sarah.

1. And it came to pass that Abraham took Ishmael, his son, and all males that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, and circumcised{a} the flesh of their foreskin as a reminder{b} of the covenant{c} Elohim{d} had made with them.
[a] Referring to cutting off a part of the foreskin of the penis; this is forbidden in the Jewish Torah, see Leviticus 19:28
[b] Abraham was circumcised and had all the men circumcised not as a part of the covenant, but as a reminder that their hearts were circumcised
[c] Hebrew "Berith;" an alliance or treaty, here a divine constitution or ordinance with signs or pledges; see 1 Moses 27
[d] See YHVH Elohim

2. And Abraham was in the ninety-nineth degree and Ishmael in the thirteenth degree when they were circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin, and this they did in remembrance of the covenant.

3. And on the same day Abraham and Ishmael were circumcised, all the men of his house, which were born in his house, and bought with money of strangers, were also circumcised with him.

4. And all they that rejected the covenant were offered a sum of money, and he goats and she goats, and camels, and sent on their way from out of the lands of Abraham; but there was none of the men that did not partake in the covenant.

5. ¶ And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{a} appeared unto Abraham in the plains of Mamre as he sat in his tent door, in the heat of the day and recovering from the wound of his hands{b}, saying: Behold!
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] Literally: "the wound of his own making" 

6. And Abraham did lift up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him;

7. And when he saw these men, he ran to meet them from his tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, saying: My brethren, if now I have found favor in your sight, pass not away, I pray you, from thy servant.

8. Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree; and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on; for this is why ye have come to your servant.

9. And they said: Go and do as thou hast said.

10. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said: Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead, and make cakes of bread upon the hearth.

11. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf, tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hastened to dress it.

12. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf, which he had dressed, and set them before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

13. And they said unto him: Where is Sarah, thy wife?

14. And Abraham answered: Behold, she is there, in the tent.

15. And one of them blessed Abraham, and he said: I will certainly return unto thee from my journey; and lo, according to the time of life, Sarah, thy wife, shall have a son.

16. And Sarah heard him in the tent door, and now Abraham and Sarah had heard this promise many times before, and not seen it fulfilled, therefore, Sarah had given up on this, believing her womb to be closed to her husband;

17. Therefore, Sarah laughed within herself, thinking: After all of these years, my womb is still empty of the seed of Abraham, and how then shall I conceive of him?

18. And the man asked of Abraham: Why does Sarah laugh? Is anything too hard for YHVH{a}?
[a] See YHVH

19. And the men revealed themselves to be malakim{a} of YHVH; and the first spoke again saying: At the time appointed, behold, I will return unto thee from my journey, which YHVH hath sent us; and according to the time of life thou mayest know that Sarah shall have a son.
[a] Malak (singular) or Malakim (plural): Hebrew meaning "angel(s)," "envoy(s)," or "messenger(s)," 1 Moses 28:26 describes these malakim as "holy men" 

20. Then Sarah denied her laughter, saying: I laughed not; for she was afraid.

21. And he said: Nay, but thou didst laugh.

22. And the malakim rose up from thence and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

23. And the first malak said unto Abraham: YHVH said unto us: Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin{a} is very grievous, I will destroy them;
[a] See Ezekiel 16:48-49

24. And YHVH will send you, and ye shall go down now and see that their iniquities are rewarded unto them; and ye shall have all things done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me.

25. And if ye do it not, it shall be upon your heads; for I will destroy them, and you shall know that I will do it, for it shall be before your eyes.

26. And the malakim, which were holy men and were sent forth after the order of El Elyon{a}, turned their faces from thence and went toward Sodom.
[a] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon 

27. ¶ But Abraham stood yet before the angel of YHVH, remembering the things which had been told him.

28. And Abraham drew near to Sodom and prayed unto YHVH, calling upon his name, saying: Wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked? Wilt thou not spare them?

29. Perhaps there are fifty righteous within the city, wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that may be therein?

30. O, may that be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked; O YHVH, may that be far from thee, for shall not the Judge of all the earth do that which is right?

31. And the angel of YHVH spoke unto Abraham, saying: If there be fifty righteous within the city of Sodom, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

32. And Abraham answered and said: Behold, now I have taken upon me to speak unto my Lord{a}, which is able to destroy the city and lay all the people to dust and ashes:
[a] Hebrew, "Adonai," "Lord;" likely because addressing the angel of YHVH; see Adonai

33. Will Thou spare them, perhaps there lack five of the fifty righteous? Wilt thou destroy all the city for their wickedness if thou should find there forty-five righteous?

34. And the angel of YHVH said: I will not destroy it, but will spare them.

35. And Abraham spake unto him again, saying: Perhaps there should be forty found there?

36. And the angel of YHVH said: I will not destroy it for the sake of forty.

37. And he pleaded again, saying: O, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak: Perhaps there shall thirty be found there?

38. And the angel of YHVH said: I will not destroy them if thou shalt find thirty there.

39. And Abraham said: Behold, now I have taken upon me to speak unto my Lord again: Wilt thou destroy them if perhaps there shall twenty be found there?

40. And the angel of YHVH spoke again saying: I will not destroy them for the sake of twenty.

41. And Abraham said: O, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Perhaps ten shall be found there?

42. And the angel of YHVH answered again saying: I will not destroy them for the sake of ten, but should there be less than this, behold I shall tell these to flee the city, and should they not look back in longing of that sinful place I shall not destroy them.

43. And the angel of YHVH when along his way; and Abraham went his way back unto his wives and their son.

44. ¶ And it came to pass that Abraham returned unto his tent in peace.

chapter-aka: Promises Kept

1. And it came to pass that the malakim{a} that had left Abraham did come to Sodom in the evening; and they found Lot sitting in the door of his house in the city of Sodom.
[a] See Malak

2. And Lot, seeing the malakim, rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground.

3. And Lot said unto them: Behold now, adonai{a}, turn in, I pray ye, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet; and ye shall rise up early and go on your way.
[a] Hebrew, "lord," formal; not to be confused with "adon," "mare," or gebir

4. And this he had spoken, for he knew of the wickedness{a} of Sodom, for the people had not heard his cries unto them unto teshuvah{b}, and he did seek to protect them, not knowing that these were malakim.
[a] See Ezekiel 16:48-49
[b] See Teshuvah

5. And they said: Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

6. And Lot pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him and entered into his house; and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread; and they did eat;

7. ¶ But before they lay down to rest, the scorners of the city of Sodom surrounded the house, even they which were both male and female, old and young; even the people from every quarter.

8. And they called unto Lot and said unto him, mockingly: Where are the men which came in unto thee this night? Bring them out unto us that we may consider them and take them to our liking{a}.
[a] The text here implies they that the citizens of Sodom did not like foreigners and wished to harm them for being in their lands

9. And Lot went out of the door unto them, and shut the door after him: and said: I plead with you as I am one of you{a}, do not so wickedly; for they are now with me and it would be a dishonor to my name should something happen to them.
[a] Lot is stating that he is not a foreigner but a fellow citizen

10. And they said unto him: Stand back! And they were angry with him.

11. And they spoke and said among themselves: This one man came in, to sojourn among us, and he is a foreigner among us; and now he thinks himself to be our judge? Now we will deal worse with him than with them! And they pressed forward as to break down the door.

12. Now this was after the wickedness of Sodom, for they had no love for their fellow men, and the foreigner among them was not welcome to dwell therein.

13. And Lot said: Behold now, I have two daughters which are betrothed and other daughters which are wed to men of this great city, and see ye that I am one of you;

14. I beg, pleading with ye, my people, for Elohim{a} cannot justify his servant in this thing;
[a] See Elohim

15. Wherefore, let me plead once again, that unto these men ye do nothing, that they may have peace in my house; for these have come under the shadow of my roof.

16. Wherefore, they came unto Lot, saying: We will have the men and thy daughters also; and we will do with them as seemeth us good.

17. And the people were angry with Lot and came near to break the door; but the malakim of El Elyon{a}, which were holy men, put forth their hands, and pulled Lot into the house unto them, and shut the door.
[a] See El Elyon

18. And the people were smote with blindness, both small and great, that they could not come at the door;

19. And they were angry, so that they wearied themselves to find the door, but in their blindness they could not find it.

20. And these, the malakim, said unto Lot: Hast thou any here besides thy wife, and thy sons-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters?

21. And Lot answered them: Nay.

22. And they commanded Lot, saying: Whatsoever thou hast in the city, thou shalt bring out of this place,

23. For we will destroy this place, for the cry of them is waxen great, and their abominations have come up before the face of YHVH Elohim{a}; and YHVH{b} hath sent us to destroy it.
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] See YHVH

24. And Lot went out and spake unto his sons-in-law, which married his daughters, and said: Up, get ye out of this place, for YHVH will destroy this city!

25. But unto his sons-in-law he seemed as one that mocked.

26. ¶ And it came to pass that when the morning came, the malakim hastened Lot, saying: Arise and take thy wife, and thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

27. And while he lingered, the malakim laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of Advu, and upon the hand of his two daughters, YHVH being merciful unto them, and they brought them forth and set them down{a} without the city.
[a] The text seems to imply that Lot, Advu, and their unmarried daughters were somehow lifted up into the air in some supernatural way and set down where they could escape

28. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that they said unto them: Escape for your lives; look not behind you, neither stay you in all the plain; but escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.

29. And Lot said unto one of them, O, no, adonai! Behold now, thy servant has found grace in thy sight,

30. And thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil overtake me, and I die.

31. Behold now, here is another city, and this is near to flee unto, and it is a little one; O, let us escape thither, and may YHVH not destroy it, and our souls shall live.

32. And the malakim said unto him: See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city of which thou hast spoken; haste thee, escape thither, for I cannot do anything until thou hast fled.

33. And the name of the city was called Bela{a}; and the sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Bela.
[a] Hebrew, from bala, "to swallow up," or "engulf"

34. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH did not destroy Sodom until Lot had entered into Bela.

35. And then, when Lot had entered into Bela, YHVH rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah; for the malakim called upon the name of YHVH for brimstone and fire from YHVH out of heaven.

36. And thus they overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

37. But it came to pass, when Lot fled, his wife, Advu, looked back from behind him and was consumed, for she longed for the vanities of Sodom.

38. ¶ And it came to pass that Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before YHVH; and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain; and behold, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

39. And he looked too over towards Salam, and it was gone, for in that same day did YHVH Elohim take Melchizedek and his people, even as he had done with Enoch{a} and his people.
[a] See Enoch 37:4

40. ¶ And it came to pass that when Elohim had destroyed the cities of the plain, that The Voice{a} spake unto Abraham, saying: I have remembered Lot and sent him out of the midst of the overthrow, that the seed of thy brother might not be destroyed when I overthrew the city in which Lot dwelt.
[a] See The Voice

41. And Abraham was comforted.

42. ¶ And Lot went up out of Bela and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Bela.

43. And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters, and upon seeing all the destruction they, the daughters of Lot, did believe themselves to be alone upon the earth.

44. And the firstborn said unto the younger: Our father has become old, and we have not a man on the earth to marry us, to live with us after the manner of all that live on the earth;

45. Therefore, come, let us make our father drink wine; and we will lie with him, that we may preserve the seed of our father.

46. For these did not know, nor did they understand, being left alone in that cave for too long by the fear of Lot, their father.

47. And it came to pass that they did wickedly and made their father drink wine that night; and the first went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose.

48. And it came to pass on the next day, that the first said unto the younger: Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also, and go thou in and lie with him, that we may preserve the seed of our father.

49. And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose.

50. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father; and the first bare a son and called his name Moab; and the younger, she also bare a son and called his name Ben-ammi.

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} visited Sarah as He had said, and that YHVH did bless Sarah even as he had spoken by the mouth of Melchizedek{b} and the malakim{c};
[a] See YHVH
[b] See 1 Moses 27:27
[c] See Malak

2. And Sarah did conceive from Abraham and did bare a son at the set time of which the malakim of Elohim{a} had spoken to them.
[a] See Elohim

3. And Abraham and Sarah called the name of their son Isaac{a}; and Abraham circumcised{b} his son Isaac, he being eight days old;
[a] Hebrew Yitschaq, "he laughs."
[b] See Circumcision

4. And Abraham blessed his son, and Sarah did begin to teach him of the covenant{a}, even as they had covenanted{b} with Elohim that they should do.
[a] See Covenant
[b] See 1 Moses 27:21

5. And Abraham and Sarah did obtain together the one hundredth degree when their son Isaac was born unto them.

6. And Sarah said: Elohim has made me to rejoice; and also all that know me will rejoice with me.

7. And she said unto Abraham: Who would have said that Sarah should have given thy children suck but YHVH? For I was barren unto thee, but YHVH promised, and I have borne a son.

8. ¶ And it came to pass that the child grew and was weaned;

9. And in that day that Isaac was weaned{a}, Abraham made a great feast; and Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, which Hagar had borne unto Abraham, cruelly scorning him to show unto him his dominance{b}; and Sarah was troubled;
[a] Likely age 12  ..
[b] Implying a sexual dominance

10. Wherefore, she said unto Abraham: Cast out this Egyptian woman and her son; for YHVH Elohim{a} has said that the son of this woman shall not be heir with my son, Isaac, and yet there he is making to mock him in cruelty.
[a] See YHVH Elohim

11. And this thing was very grievous unto Abraham because of his sons, for he feared that Ishmael should do harm unto Isaac.

12. And The Voice{a} said unto Abraham: Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of thy son and because of thy wife, Hagar; in all that Sarah has said unto thee, hearken unto her voice, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called;
[a] See The Voice

13. But fear not for Ishmael, for the son of Hagar will I make a nation also for he is thy seed,

14. And the day shall surely come when they too shall partake of their inheritance because of the seed of thy son with Sarah, even Isaac.

15. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave unto Hagar; and she took the child, and he sent her away; and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Bearsheba.

16. And it came to pass that the water was spent in the bottle; and she cast Ishmael under one of the shrubs, and she went and sat herself down over against the child, a good way off, as it were a bowshot; for she said: Let me not see the death of my child.

17. And as she sat over away from her son, she lifted up her voice, and wept.

18. And Elohim heard her cries; and the angel of YHVH{a} called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her: What troubles thee, Hagar?
[a] See Angel of YHVH

19. Fear not, for Elohim hath heard the voice of Ishmael where he lieth.

20. Arise, therefore, and lift him up, and hold him in thine hand; for Allah{a} will make of him a great nation.
[a] Allah: Arabic, "God;" See Allah

21. And Elohim opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave her son to drink.

22. And Elohim was with Ismael; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, becoming an archer{a};
[a] Nimrod was also an archer, this may be in the text to show that while he had the truth, he did not fully embrace it, much like Nimrod

23. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, he and his mother, and he took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

1. And it came to pass that after Hagar was sent away that Abraham and Sarah took another wife, and her name was Qeturah{a} and she bore him six sons who’s names were: Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
[a] Hebrew, "incense."

2. And it came to pass that Abraham gave gifts unto these sons, and sent them away from Isaac, his son with Sarah, while he yet lived, Eastward{a}, unto the East country;
[a] See Cardinal directions

3. And Abraham did continue to care{a} for Hagar and Ishmael, and Qeturah and her sons as was his obligation{b}; and he did fulfill all his duties unto them;
[a] Monetary assistance
[b] See 5 Moses 25:31-32 

4. But to Isaac was given the covenant, and so it was that it was the son of Sarah by him that he kept nearest to his heart, and unto the others a portion was given and these he sent on their way; and this made Sarah to rejoice in her heart.

5. ¶ And it came to pass that after these things, Ha’Elohim{a} did call unto Abraham, and said unto him: Abraham!
[a] See Ha'Elohim

6. And Abraham answered, saying: Lo! Behold, here am I{a}.
[a] Hinneh: Hebrew, "Lo," "Behold," "Here am I;" a combination of two Hebrew words: hineh and ani, meaning "here" and "I;" a term with a special meaning or connotation in Hebrew as it is a way of expressing readiness to fully give of one’s self: Another translation would be, "I’m at Your service!"

7. And Ha’Elohim said: Take now thy beloved son, Isaac, whom thou lovest the most of all thy seed, and get thee into the land of Moriah;

8. And there, ascend upon one of the mountains of which I will tell thee, and there thou shall offer thy son fully unto me.

9. And after this, Abraham worried and pondered: How shall I separate my son Isaac from Sarah, his mother, that I may take him up for to sacrifice him as an offering unto YHVH{a}?
[a] See YHVH

10. And Abraham came into the tent of Sarah, and he sat before his wife, and as she saw him, being troubled, she spoke unto him, saying: My son, Isaac, is grown; it is time that he learn the mysteries of YHVH Elohim{a}, even that which Melchizedek{b} did teach unto us;
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] See 1 Moses 27

11. Now tomorrow, I pray thee, go forth and take him to the mountain of YHVH, and there he will learn the ways of YHVH:

12. For thou shall teach our son to know YHVH by the signs and tokens{a} given us, as well as to know that when he prayeth continually before YHVH, Ha’Elohim will answer him;
[a] See Signs and tokens

13. Therefore, do this, I pray thee, that our son will know the way of serving YHVH, his Elohim.

14. And Abraham was troubled in his heart no more for getting his son away from his mother, for he had seen the will of YHVH manifest before his eyes;

15. Yet this was still a hard and terrible thing he thought to do, and there rose up much sorrow within the man{a} Abraham.
[a] Adam: Hebrew, "human," or "mankind"

16. ¶ And it came to pass that Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

17. And it came to pass that on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off, and they rose up and gathered up wood that he should burn an offering to YHVH.

18. And Abraham said unto the two young men: Abide you here with the ass, and I and my son will go yonder, and worship, and then come back here to you again.

19. And Abraham took the wood for the offering and laid it upon Isaac’s back; and he took the fire in his hand, and his athame{a}, and Isaac his son; and they walked up, united together in their purpose.
[a] A sacrificial knife dedicated to God; see Athame 

20. And Isaac did speak unto Abraham, his father, and said: Father?

21. And Abraham said, Here am I, my son.

22. And Isaac said: Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for an offering?

23. And Abraham said: My son, Elohim will personally provide a lamb unto us for the offering; and the two of them went on, both of them together, united in their purpose.

24. ¶ And it came to pass that they came to the place of which Ha’Elohim had shown unto Abraham; and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order.

25. And Isaac spoke unto to his father, saying: Bind me securely and place me there upon the altar lest, in fear I turn and move, or break loose from the force of the knife upon my flesh to profane the offering.

26. And Abraham bound Isaac, his son, and Isaac struggled not; and Abraham laid his beloved son on the altar, upon the wood, and stretched forth his hand to take up the knifed with the intent to slaughter his son:

27. And the angel of YHVH{a} called unto Abraham from out of heaven, saying: Abraham! Abraham!
[a] See Angel of YHVH

28. And Abraham said: Here am I!

29. And the angel of YHVH said: Lay not thine hand upon thy son, neither do thou anything to harm{a} him;
[a] See 1 Moses 13:20-22

30. For thou knowest that thou fearest Elohim, seeing thou hast not withheld thy beloved son, thine only Isaac, son of Sarah from thy seed, from me.

31. And at no time did I say that thou should slay thy son, but this thou feared for the great love that thou hast for Him;

32. And behold: ye both now see that was a similitude of Ha’Elohim and the Yachad Yachid Echad{a} which shall be sent, the Messiah{b} of the world forever and ever.
[a] See Yachad Yachid Echad
[b] Hebrew, "Anointed one," "Savior," or "Christ"

33. And as Abraham understood, he lifted up his eyes and looked; and he beheld, behind a thicket, there was a ram, and he caught it by his horns;

34. And Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered him up for an offering in the stead of his son; and he and Isaac did eat of it in remembrance of the Son of Man that should come.

35. ¶ And it came to pass that Abraham told Isaac of his vision{a} in the fire that night as the fire burn on and began to teach his son all he knew{b} of YHVH Elohim.
[a] See 1 Moses 26:20
[b] Abraham is ordaining Isaac and giving him his Initiatories and certain Endowments

36. And Abraham called the name of that place YHVH Yir’eh, or YHVH Will Provide; for on the Mountain of YHVH it shall be provided.

37. ¶ And the angel of YHVH called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, saying: Thus saith YHVH: A covenant had been made in the heavens before the world was by created by Ha’Elohim,

38. That because this Adam{a} hath done this thing, and hast not withheld his beloved son, the only son of Abraham and Sarah, from me,
[a] Adam: Hebrew, "human," "mankind"

39. And even though I did not ask of it, yet thou wast willing to give him, and that in offering to thy Elohim, I will bless thee for the life of thy son, but not by his death;

40. And in this covenant which Ha’Elohim hath made before thou wast born ye shall be blessed, Adam{a}, in multiplying.
[a] Adam: Hebrew, "human," "mankind"

41. And before the world was, thou was told: I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is upon the seashore;

42. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou should obey my Voice{a}.
[a] See The Voice

43. And behold, I knew this of thee before we made the covenant here upon this earth, you and I, and because I knew, I made an everlasting covenant{a}, yea, and even a new and everlasting covenant{b} with thee and with thy household, and with every generation to spring forth from thee unto the end of the earth.
[a] See Everlasting covenant
[b] See New and everlasting covenant 

44. But know thou this, and teach it unto thy seed and them to teach their seed after thee, unto every generation unto the end of the earth: I, YHVH, take no joy in the shedding of blood{a};
[a] See 1 Moses 13:20-22

45. Yea, and all life is precious unto me; therefore, know ye, both thou and thy seed, that I shall never require the sacrifice of thee, or thy seed, nor of any of thy family, nor any other Adam{a};
[a] Adam: Hebrew, "human," or "mankind"

46. For such is an abomination unto me, and life should never be shed except to save a life, even as thy father and mother, Noah and Na’amah, taught{a} thee.
[a] See 1 Moses 13:20-22

47. ¶ And it came to pass that after Abraham had finished instructing his son, he and Isaac returned unto the young men, and they rose up and went to Bearsheba; and Abraham dwelt at Bearsheba.

1. And it came to pass that after these, Isaac was anointed, and Abraham had returned home that it was told unto Abraham, saying: Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children unto thy brother Nahor; Huz is his firstborn,and Buz is his brother.

2. And Kemuel is the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Haza, and Bildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel; and Bethuel begat Rebekah.

3. These eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother; and his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.

4. ¶ And now it came to pass that Abraham was along in years, and YHVH{a} had blessed him in every way.
[a] See YHVH

5. And so, it came to pass that Abraham said unto Evad{a}, the most trusted servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had:
[a] Hebrew, "servant"

6. Put forth, I pray thee, thy hand under my hand, and I will make thee swear{a} before YHVH, the Elohim{b} of heaven and the Elohim of the earth, that thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac;
[a] See Covenant
[b] See Elohim

7. For my son must not take a wife unto of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell; for these are idolaters and should these lead him astray, I will not have kept the Covenant{a}.
[a] See Covenant

8. And Evad said unto him: Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land; therefore, should I return thy son again unto the land from whence thou came?

9. And Abraham said unto him: No, thou shall not bring my son to that land, for YHVH, Elohim of the heavens, which took{a} me from the house of my father and from the land of my kindred, and which spoke unto me, and that swore unto me, saying: Unto thee will I give this land{b}.
[a] See 1 Moses 22:13-16
[b] See 1 Moses 22:36

10. And YHVH Elohim{a} shall send an angel{b} before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from that land:
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] Here a symbolic or supernatural entity; see Malak 

11. And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this thine oath; only bring not my son to that land but keep him here.

12. And Evad put his hand under the hand of Abraham and swore unto him an oath{a} concerning the matter.
[a] Or "covenant"

13. ¶ And it came to pass that Evad took him ten camels of Abraham when he arose the next morning, and he went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor,

14. And he did depart with many gifts for and offering to the family of the woman that YHVH should send him too, for all the goods of Abraham were in his hand.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Sarah too was on in years, and so it was that not much time had passed after the servant of Abraham had left that Sarah died; and thus ended the years of the life of Sarah;

16. And Sarah had reached the one-hundred and twenty-seventh degree when she died.

17. And Sarah had been the High Priestess ordained by Melchizedek, in her generation; the great Matriarch, and beloved Sister{a} to all in every generation:
[a] Hebrew, "achoth," sister or a female relative; can be literal or figurative

18. And she was the sister of Abraham being the daughter of his father but not his mother, and our Sister in Wisdom{a}, for she did walk and talk as one with the Shekinah{b} upon the earth;
[a] Chokhmah: Hebrew, "wisdom;" See Chokhmah
[b] Hebrew, "The Presence," or "the dwelling place of God;" see Shekinah

19. And Shekinah was truly with her, and thus it is that she is both Mother and Sister to the very souls of all mankind{a}, even as Eve before her, as these find rest in the divine light and life.
[a] Adam, Hebrew, "mankind"

20. And so it is that all who shall live by the Shekinah that hears our pleas into Ha’Elohim{a} will find rest in her beauty{b}; therefore the children of Elohim will have no fear over whatsoever shall come to pass.
[a] See Ha'Elohim
[b] Or "radiance"

21. ¶ And Abraham lamented and mourned for Sarah, and he wept for her, his wife which was dead.

22. And Abraham stood up from before his dead and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying: I am a stranger and a sojourner with you;

23. And give unto me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight, for I can bear to look upon her no longer.

24. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him: Hear us, my lord{a}; thou art a mighty prince among us, one chosen of Elohim;
[a] See Adonai

25. Therefore, bury thou thy dead in the choicest of our sepulchers; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher{a}, but it shall be given thee that thou mayest bury thy dead.
[a] A place where a dead person is laid or buried

26. And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, and to the children of Heth; and he communed with them, saying: If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me!

27. And Abraham entreated Ephron, the son of Zohar, saying: Give unto me the cave of Machpelah, which thou hath in the end of thy field,

28. And I shall pay as much money as it is worth, if thou will give it me for a possession to use as a burying place among you.

29. And now Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, among all of them that went in at the gates of the city, saying: Hearken, my lord, and hear me;

30. The field I give thee and the cave that is therein; I give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people; and I give it thee; therefore, bury thy dead.

31. And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land,

32. And he spoke unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying: I pray thee, hear me; if thou wilt take it of me, I will give thee money for the field, and I will bury my dead there; but I will give thee money for it.

33. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him: My lord, hearken unto me; the land thou shalt have for four hundred shekels of silver; what shall that be betwixt me and thee? Bury, therefore, thy dead.

34. And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed unto Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, which was current with the merchant.

35. And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein,

36. And all the trees that were in the field and that were in all the borders round about were made sure unto Abraham for a possession, in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of the city.

37. ¶ And after this, Abraham buried Sarah, his wife, the wife of kings, and mother of the righteous, in the cave of the field of Machpelah, for he could bear to look upon her flesh no longer for the pain of it.

38. And the field and the cave that was therein were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the sons of Heth.

chapter-aka: Given to Drink

1. And it came to pass that Evad, the servant of Abraham, knew not of the death of Sarah, but was about his journey when he stopped to make his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at evening, the time that women go out to draw water.

2. And he prayed, saying: O YHVH{a}! Elohim{b} of my lord{c}, Abraham, I pray thee this day, that thou wouldest show kindness unto my lord Abraham and send me good speed.
[a] See YHVH 
[b] See Elohim
[c] Adon: Hebrew, "lord"

3. Behold, I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water;

4. And so, let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say: Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink, and she shall say: Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also, let her be the one whom thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac.

5. And thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my lord, Abraham.

6. ¶ And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah{a} came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
[a] Rebekah: Hebrew, "Ribqah;" "to bind;" Rabbi Isaac considered Rebecca emblematic of Israel's among the nations as she lived among idol worshippers; see Zohar, Bereshit 1:137a  

7. And the damsel, being a young maiden, was very fair to look upon, such as the servant of Abraham had not seen, neither had any man known the like unto her,

8. And he beheld her as she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.

9. And Evad ran to meet her and said: Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

10. And she said: Drink, my lord; and she hastened, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

11. And when she had done giving him drink, she said: I will draw for thy camels also until they have done drinking.

12. And she hastened, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.

13. And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, pondering in his heart whether YHVH had made his journey prosperous or not.

14. ¶ And it came to pass that as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a gold earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, and gave them to her;

15. And Evad did ask her: Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee; and is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

16. And she spoke unto him, saying: I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

17. And she continued to speak, saying unto him: We have both straw, and food enough, and room to lodge in.

18. And the man bowed down his head and worshiped YHVH.

19. And he said: Blessed is YHVH, Elohim of my lord Abraham, who hath not left my lord destitute of Mercy and Truth; and when I was in the way, YHVH led me to the house of my master's brethren.

20. And the damsel ran to the house and told her mother these things.

21. And Rebekah had a brother, whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, unto the well.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that when he saw the earrings, and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah, his sister, saying: Thus spake the man unto me, and I came unto the man, and behold, he stood by the camels at the well,

23. And he said: Come in, thou blessed of YHVH; wherefore standest thou without? For I have prepared the house and room for the camels.

24. And the man came into the house, and he unburdened his camels and gave straw, and food for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that came with him.

25. And there was set before him food to eat; but he said: I will not eat until I have told mine errand.

26. And Laban said: Speak on.

27. And he said: I am the servant of Abraham; and YHVH hath blessed my lord greatly, and he is become great; and he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and menservants and maidservants, and camels and asses.

28. And Sarah, the wife of my lord, bore a son to my master; and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

29. And my lord made me swear, saying{a}: Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell; but thou shalt go unto my father's house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son.
[a] See 1 Moses 32:5-10; Genesis 24:3-8

30. And I said unto my lord: Perhaps the woman will not follow me?

31. And he said unto me: YHVH, before whom I walk, will send his angel{a} with thee; and he will prosper thy way;
[a] See "Malak" Genesis 24:17-18

32. And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my father's house; then shalt thou be clear of my oath.

33. When thou comest to my kindred, and if they give thee not a wife for my son, thou shalt be clear from my oath.

34. And I came this day unto the well{a} and said: O YHVH, Elohim of my lord Abraham, if now thou wilt prosper my way which I go,
[a] See 1 Moses 33:9-11;

35. Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the young maiden cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her: Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink,

36. And if she should say unto me: Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels, the same is the woman whom YHVH hath appointed out for my the son of my lord.

37. And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well and drew water.

38. And I said unto her: Let me drink, I pray thee.

39. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said: Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; and so it was that I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

40. And I asked her and said: Whose daughter art thou?

41. And she answered me, saying: The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, whom Milcah bare unto him.

42. And I gave the earrings unto her to put into her ears and the bracelets upon her hands.

43. And I bowed down my head, and worshiped YHVH, and blessed YHVH, the Elohim of my lord, Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

44. ¶ And now, if thou wilt deal kindly and truly with my lord, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.

45. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: The thing proceedeth from YHVH; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

46. Behold, Rebekah is before thee; take her and go; and let her be thy lord's son's wife, as YHVH hath spoken.

47. ¶ And it came to pass that, when Abraham's servant heard these words, he worshiped YHVH, bowing himself to the earth;

48. And Evad brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave to Rebekah.

49. And he gave also unto her brother and to her mother many precious{a} things, and they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night.
[a] Gifts as he is taking their daughter, this can be seen as buying her and showing them that they can afford to give her a good life

chapter-aka: Journey Home

1. And it came to pass that when they arose up in the morning, Evad, the servant of Abraham, said: Send me away unto my lord{a}.
[a] Adon: Hebrew, "lord"

2. And the brother and mother of Rebekah said: Let the young maiden abide with us at the least ten{a} days, perhaps more; and after that she shall go.
[a] Or "a few days;" a way of saying "a short time"

3. And the chief servant of Abraham said unto them: Hinder me not, seeing YHVH{a} hath prospered{b} my way; send me away therefore, that I may go unto my lord; and this young woman, that she shall meet her husband.
[a] See YHVH
[b] Or "made a way for me to do this task"

4. And they said: We will call the damsel{a} and inquire at her mouth{b}.
[a] Or "young woman"
[b] Or "let us see what she has to say in this matter and do as she wishes"

5. And they called Rebekah, and they said unto her: Wilt thou go with this man?

6. And she answered them: I will go, for we do see that it is surely the will of YHVH Elohim{a}, and who are we to deny they{b} that created us?
[a] See YHVH Elohim
[b] Noting her belief in multiple gods of Gods; see Ha'Elohim

7. And they sent away their sister Rebekah, and her nurse, and Evad, and his men;

8. And they blessed Rebekah and said{a} unto her: O thou, our sister, be thou blessed of thousands, of millions; and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.
[a] It is unknown who is blessing her here

9. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels and followed the man; and Evad took Rebekah and went his way.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that when they arrived, Isaac came from the direction of the well Bearlahai’roi; for he dwelt in the south country.

11. And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the field at eventide, for he sought to know his fortune;

12. And there he was given a dream, a vision of YHVH; and in his vision he did see the sun and the moon, and there was a crown upon the head of his father, Abraham;

13. And there came from the heavens a large man that shined as the light, and Isaac saw that this man was the very Father of Light{a}.
[a] Or "the Father of Heavenly light," a name for God, representing both God the Father, and the Son Jesus Christ; see 1 Moses 24:24, James 1:17

14. And the Son of Man{a} took light greater than the sun from his head, and yet left the rays behind with the Man.
[a] See Son of Man

15. And the sun and the moon and the stars lamented, saying: Take not away thy glory from us, for only from thee have we power.

16. And that Man answered them saying: Weep not that I take thy light from out of thy house, for it is taken up from thy troubles unto rest and that ye shall be lifted up upon high and exalted.

17. And he saw that they lift his father, Abraham up from a narrow space to a wide place; yea, and they did raise up him from darkness to light; and he saw his mother, Sarah, even more beautiful, delightsome, and pure than in life; and there she did wait with many others for her husband.

18. And Isaac said: I beseech thee, YHVH, turn also thy rays upon me!

19. And there, in the vision, he was taken up, and he thought he saw YHVH Elohim summoning the archangel Michael{a}, and saying unto him: Go down, Michael, to thy seed;
[a] See Michael

20. Go thou unto Abraham, my beloved friend; and there thou shall tell him of his death;

21. And behold, thou shalt call unto him saying: Depart thee from this world, and go forth to YHVH, thy Elohim.

22. Then Isaac saw, and heard Michael saying: Hear, O righteous Abraham; it is given thee to know, O most honored Abraham, that thy sojourn{a} is done, and thou shalt leave this, the earth, and thy soul shall dwell with El Elyon{b}.
[a] Or "abide;" a visit or temporary stay
[b] See El Elyon

23. And Isaac saw that the light of the sun became his father, and the moon likewise is Sarah, his mother.

24. And the Man{a} bearing light sent who His Son{b}, who descended from the heavens from Ha’Elohim{c}, who is the most righteous soul from whom all Law{d} is given.
[a] Father of Light, here God the Father; see Father of Light
[b] God the Son
[c] See Ha'Elohim
[d] Hebrew "Teachings," "Instructions," or "Law"

25. And Isaac saw that Michael went down, and he said unto the friend of YHVH: This day shalt thou depart from this life; and, behold, the days of thy sojourn here are fulfilled.

26. And Abraham said unto him: Amen{a}! Be it so; thou art kind, good Father; open thy gates, Father, that I may not weep too long for my son, nor weep any longer for my wives.
[a] Hebrew, "verily," "truth," or "truly"

27. And Michael took{a} Abraham into a chariot of cherubim{b}, and brought him up into the heavens, and led him upon the clouds together with sixty angels;
[a] Here a vision representing death
[b] The ninth or lowest class of angels; see Cherubim

28. And the chariot flew over all the creation; and Michael drove it forth, and it went up into the heavens.

29. ¶ And Isaac was taken from his dream{a}, knowing that his father too should die; and there he was prompted to raise up; and he lifted up his eyes, and saw and beheld the camels coming.
[a] Or "vision"

30. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes; and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel; for she said unto the servant: What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us?

31. And the servant said: It is my lord; therefore, she took a veil and covered herself.

32. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.

33. And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother, Sarah, and took{a} Rebekah; and she became his wife, and he loved her.
[a] Implying they consummated their union before being wed

34. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

35. ¶ And it came to pass that Abraham, being well pleased in seeing his son, Isaac, the son of his Sarah, comforted by Rebekah, that then Abraham did give up the ghost, even as Isaac had divined:

36. And Abraham died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people;

37. ¶ And it came to pass that Abraham, friend of YHVH, and entertainer of angels, lived to reach the one hundred and seventy-fifth degree.

chapter-aka: The Well of Living Water

1. And it came to pass that the sons of Abraham, Isaac and Ishmael, did bury Abraham with Sarah, his wife, in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar, the Hittite, which is at Mamre, in the field which Abraham purchased{a} of the sons of Heth.
[a] See 1 Moses 32:26-33

2. And it was that Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac; for Abraham had given gifts to his other sons{a} given him of his other wives, and he did send them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east{b}.
[a] See 1 Moses 31:1-4
[b] See Cardinal directions

3. ¶ And it came to pass that there was a famine in the land, and Isaac went unto Abimelech, king of the Philistines, unto Gerar;

4. For the angel of YHVH{a} did appeared unto him, saying: Go not down into Egypt{b}; but dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] See Egypt

5. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries, for thou art of the oath{a} made between YHVH Elohim{b} and Abraham, thy father;
[a] See Covenant, Everlasting covenant, New and everlasting covenant
[b] See YHVH Elohim

6. And thus it shall be that thy seed shall multiply as the stars of the heavens, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,

7. And because Abraham did obey my Voice{a} and kept my charge, my Law, my statutes, and my mitzvoth{b}.
[a] See The Voice
[b] Hebrew, calling, commandment, or religious duty

8. ¶ And so it was{a} that Isaac and his wife, Rebekah, did dwell in Gerar.
[a] "And it came to pass"

9. And the men of that place asked him concerning his wife, and Isaac remembered that his father, Abraham had said{a} of his mother, Sarah: She is my sister; and this he knew had been done for a wise purpose in YHVH{b};
[a] See 1 Moses 24:21
[b] See YHVH

10. And he feared to say: She is my wife, lest the men of the place should kill him to take Rebekah unto themselves because she was fair to look upon;

11. Therefore, he said unto these men: She is my sister{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "achoth;" sometimes translated as "bride" as this term can imply marriage to a half-sister; see Song of Solomon 4:9-10, 5:12

12. ¶ And it came to pass that Abimelech, king of the Philistines, remembered{a} also Abraham and Sarah and how they had said the same, and he did spy upon them;
[a] See 1 Moses 24:20-40

13. And after they had been there for some time, one morning when they thought they were alone, he looked out his window and saw, and he beheld that Isaac was caressing Rebekah, as his wife.

14. And Abimelech called Isaac and said: Behold, surely Rebekah is thy wife! And why then didst thou say unto us: She is thy sister?

15. And Isaac spoke unto him, saying: I said it because I feared lest I die because of her great beauty.

16. And Abimelech said: What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us for thy deception.

17. And Abimelech charged all his people, saying: He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

18. ¶ Now it came to pass that Isaac sowed in that land, and in the same year he did receive a hundredfold; for YHVH did blessed him.

19. And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great; for he had many flocks, and herds, and laborers; and so it was that the Philistines envied him.

20. And it came to pass that the Philistines took dirt and filled up all the wells which had been dug in the days of Abraham, his father, that they were dried up.

21. And Abimelech said unto Isaac: Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.

23. And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which had been dug in the days of Abraham, his father, that the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called the names of these after the names by which his father had called them.

24. And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley and found there a well of springing water;

25. And it came to pass that the herdsmen of Gerar did argue with Isaac's herdsmen, saying: The water is ours! And Isaac did name the well Eseq{a} because they fought with him.
[a] Hebrew, contention"

26. And they dug another well and they contended with him for that also; and he called the name of it Sitnah{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "hostility."

27. ¶ And it came to pass that Isaac removed himself and his people from thence and dug another well; and for that they strove not; and he called the name of it Rechoboth{a};
[a] Herbew, "broad places."

28. And Isaac said: For now YHVH{a} hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land; and he went up from thence to Bearsheba.
[a] See YHVH

29. ¶ And the angel of YHVH{a} appeared unto him the same night, saying: I am the Elohim{b} of Abraham, thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for the sake of my servant, Abraham.
[a] Angel of YHVH
[b] See Elohim

30. And be thou not troubled therefore of the wells, for so it is also that when YHVH Elohim helpeth mankind{a} to find the well of living water{b}, so too doth the pride of man come, saying: This well is mine!
[a] Adam: Hebrew, "human," or "mankind;" here "man"
[b] See Melchizedek 4:4, 6:22; Zenos 7:9, 1 Nephi 3:68 RAV, 11:25a OPV; John 4:14, 7:38; Doctriens of the Saints 36a:30-31 

31. And thus ye contend with one another over the source of living water which floweth and giveth freely;

32. Therefore, it pleaseth me that thou should dig up the well, and then to give it up, that source of life, to avoid contending with those that would offend thee.

33. And Isaac built an altar there, and called upon the name of YHVH, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well.

34. ¶ Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phichol, the chief captain of his army.

35. And Isaac said unto them: Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you?

36. And they replied, saying: We saw certainly that YHVH was with thee; and we said: Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee:

37. That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace; thou art now the blessed of YHVH.

38. And Isaac made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

39. And they rose up very early in the morning the following day and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

40. ¶ And it came to pass the same day that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said unto him: We have found water, and he called it Shibah{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "an oath;" from the root sheba, "seven."

chapter-aka: Jacob and Esau

1. And these are the generations of Isaac, the son of Abraham: Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac was at the fortieth degree when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel, the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban, the Syrian.

2. ¶ And it came to pass that after the death of Abraham Ha’Elohim{a} did bless his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt towards the well, Bearlahai’roi.
[a] Or "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim

3. And Isaac entreated YHVH{a} for his wife, that she might bear children, for she was barren; and YHVH did smell of the incense that Isaac sent up, and was entreated of him, and Rebekah, his wife, conceived.
[a] See YHVH

4. ¶ And it came to pass that the children struggled together within her womb; and she said: What is this that is happening with me? And if I am with child, why is it thus with me?

5. And she went forth to her sacred place to burn incense, and to seek the face{a} of YHVH.
[a] See Shekinah

6. And the angel of YHVH{a} came before her, saying: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels;
[a] See Angel of YHVH

7. And it shall be that one shall be conquer the other, making firm his strength and courage; and so it shall be that the elder shall serve the younger.

8. ¶ And it came to pass that when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, lo! She beheld that it was as the angel of YHVH had spoken, there were twins in her womb:

9. And the first came out healthy, and red in color, with hair all over him, like unto a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau{a}.
[a] Esau: Hebrew, "Esav," meaning "hairy;" from asah, "to press" or "squeeze"

10. And after this, came his brother out, his hands grasping onto the heel of Esau; and his name was called Jacob{a}.
[a] Jacob: Hebrew, "Yaaqov," meaning "to follow," "to be behind" or "to supplant," "circumvent," "assail," "overreach;" from aqeb, "heel"

11. And Isaac had entered into the sixtieth degree when she bore them, and she in the sixty-fifth.

12. ¶ And it came to pass that when the boys were grown that Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the earth and of the field;

13. And Jacob was a peaceful man, whole and blameless{a}; for Jacob did dwell in a tent{b}.
[a] Or "a righteous man"
[b] See 1 Nephi 1:46RAV, 2:15 OPV. This may refer to the temple, or a personal temple such as a tallit

14. And Isaac favored Esau because he did eat of his wild game; but Rebekah favored Jacob.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Esau went in the field to hunt when Amraphél, a descendant of Nimrod{a}, king over Babel, was hunting with his men in the field in the cool air of the morning times.
[a] See Nimrod; 1 Moses 17-20

16. And Amraphél began to observe Esau all the days, for a jealousy was formed his heart against Esau.

17. And as Esau went about the field to hunt, and he found Amraphél outside, walking in the wilderness with two of his strong men;

18. And Esau saw that all the mighty men and people of Amraphél were with him in the wilderness;

19. But they had removed at a distance from him, and they went from him in different directions to hunt.

20. And Esau, seeing that he was being hunted, concealed himself from Amraphél, and he began to likewise hunt him in the wilderness.

21. And Amraphél and the men that were with him came to the place where Esau was hidden, and it came to pass that Esau came up suddenly from his where he was hidden, and he smote off the head of Amraphél.

22. And Esau began to fight with a mighty fierceness against two of the men that were with Amraphél, that they should not called out to their people;

23. And Esau did prevail against them and smote them to death with his own sword.

24. And Esau knew that the people of Amraphél, and his might and strong ones, were at a distance; therefore he fled, thereby escaped unbeknownst to them;

25. And Esau took with him the garments of Adam that had been taken{a} by Ham, and passed down and given unto Amraphél, as his forefather, Nimrod, hand been given.
[a] See 1 Moses 14:15 

26. And it came to pass that Esau did run off and he did conceal the holy garments in his house.

27. And one of the mighty men of Amraphél, who had left him found their king and the two men that were with him lying dead in the wilderness, and none could find he that had slain them.

28. ¶ And it came to pass that in that same day, Jacob was boiling a pottage; and Esau came from the field, and he was weary from hunger.

29. And Esau said unto Jacob: Feed me, I pray thee, with that same rosy pottage; for I am faint from hunger.

30. And so it was that Esau was also called Edom{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "red"

31. And Jacob, being cunning replied unto his elder brother: Sell me this day thy birthright.

32. And Esau did plead unto him, saying: Behold, I am at weary of hunger even unto death; and what then shall this birthright profit me?

33. And Jacob said: Swear to me first this day.

34. And Esau did go unto his house and did take up the garment of Adam and gave them to his brother, Jacob, and did swear unto him; and so it was that he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

35. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and some of that stew; and Esau did eat, and drink.

36. And when he had his fill, Esau did rise up, and walked off, for he understood not what he had done in selling his birthright nor in giving up the holy garments of his fathers.

37. And it was by means this that the garments of Adam and Eve were given back into the hands of the descendants of Shem, to whom Noah and Na’aham would have given them;

38. And all this was done, even as the angel of YHVH had told their mother, Rebekah, that the elder brother should come to serve the younger.

39. ¶ And it came to pass that Esau took to wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hittite, and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon, the Hittite, which was a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

chapter-aka: Ishmael

1. Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian bore unto Abraham; and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, and Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

2. And these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their towns and by their strongholds, twelve princes{a}, according to their tribes.
[a] See 1 Moses 27:39

3. ¶ And Ishmael lived a full life, and in his old age he gave up his last breath and died, yet before he did die, Ishmael was visited by his brother, Isaac;

4. And the mouth of Isaac was opened to speak the words of YHVH Elohim, saying: A blessing I place upon thee and thy seed that shall come after thee.

5. The day shall come at the last when men and women everywhere will hear of wars and rumors of wars;

6. And nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, for mankind shall have become a blight upon the earth bringing forth earthquakes, plagues, and it shall be as though the very stars shall divert from their courses.

7. And in that day shall three of the sons of Hagar go forth in righteousness unto the people of Ishmael; and these three will come down out of the land in swiftness;

8. For the people of Ishmael shall be a people of submission, yet each shall fall in opposition and in defiance of their brethren.

9. For YHVH Elohim shall send them a prophet{a}, the Tzadik Yachad{b} of that generation, to teach them the submission of YHVH{c},
[a] Likely Muhammad ibn Abdullah, the  founder of Islam
[b] See Tzadik Yachad
[c] See YHVH

10. And there shall be infinite and innumerable multitudes that shall bow to him—yet the Son of Man{a} they shall know not, not at the first.
[a] Son of Man: Hebrew, here a name for Jesus Christ

11. And in many places, yea even diverse places, and in all nations shall the sons of Ishmael deny the Yachad Yachid Echad{a}, and yet the holy gifts will follow them; and every sacrifice will be acceptable to YHVH in their arrogance.
[a] See Yachad Yachid Echad

12. And the sons of Ishmael will cry out with a great voice, boasting and saying: Where art thy Elohim{a}?
[a] Hebrew, "Gods;" here meaning both the Jewish and Christian God(s), and pagan gods

13. And they shall roar as lions against the children of Isaac, though they shall too be the blood of Abraham.

14. And YHVH will extend His hand toward the children of Ishmael as a great sound from heaven, and by the voice of an angel from the heavens;

15. And then shall YHVH raise up His head and set his fury against the sons of Ishmael.

16. And it shall come to pass that YHVH shall gather two young men of the sons of Ishmael and He will raise them up as fire burning the field of dry reeds, being burnt up; and they shall be preserved by the mercy of YHVH.

17. And from fire, which shall be the judgement of YHVH, in the nation of Ishmael, will remain only three houses:

18. And in the first house shall the sons of Ishmael serve the sword and dwell in captivity, and will desire to see their father, Ishmael and will not find him.

19. And in the second house there will be many altars built up and found acceptable to YHVH Elohim in all the civilized{a} world;
[a] Hebrew "shaphat;" other tanslations could be "judged" or "governed;" this being an inspired translation, "civilized" used here for modern readers

20. And unto them shall be given that all the mountains will be inhabited; and the bread and the wine and the olive oil and the gold and the silver will increase in them over all the earth;

21. And it shall come to pass that these shall throw away{a} their weapons of war, that they might till the soil and to spill blood never again;
[a] See Alma 14:27-28 RAV, 24:6 OPV

22. And men shall come from all the ends of the earth to make war with these, the second house of Ishmael, but war shall not find them.

23. And in the third house shall the walls be torn down, and the doors shall be opened, and they shall see a great scepter arise from the children of Isaac and all they that have been dispersed shall be gathered together;

24. And all the children of Abraham shall be gathered together and they will come to Yachad Yachid Echad, their King, and then shall the Son of Man rule in all the earth.

25. And then shall the time come that there will be an abundance of grain, and wine, and olive oil shall overflow their vessels, as none have seen since the foundation of the world.

26. And the seed of the tree{a} that YHVH has planted upon all the earth will be complete, and the land will be fruitful and will produce her fruits a hundredfold.
[a] The tree of life, or the creation

27. ¶ And upon hearing these words Ishmael was offended, thinking his younger brother should steal his birthright even unto the end of days;

28. Yet to Hagar came the judgment of the covenant through her husband, Abraham, and through Sarah the mercy, as she was blessed of Melchizedek.

29. ¶ And it came to pass that Ismael died in the presence of all his brethren, and YHVH Elohim took him into His mercy; yea, and he was taken up unto his{a} people.
[a] It is unclear by the text is "his" refers to YHVH's people (the people of God), or Ishmael's family, through the Holy Ghost we can be assured that they are one in the same

chapter-aka: The Deception and the Blessing

1. And it came to pass that when Isaac was old, and his eyes had grown dull, and he had become blind; he called Esau, his eldest son, and said unto him: My son.

2. And Esau said unto him: Behold, here am I{a}.
[a] Hebrew, Hinneh; "Lo!" "Behold," "Here am I;" this term is the combination of two Hebrew words: hineh and ani, meaning "here" and "I;" the term has a special meaning or connotation in Hebrew as it is a way of expressing readiness to fully give of one’s self; another translation would be, "I’m at Your service!"

3. And Isaac said: Behold, now I am old, I know not the day of my death; therefore, take, I pray thee, thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison, and make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; and do this that my soul may bless thee before I die.

4. And now, Rebekah heard that which Isaac said unto Esau, his son; and it came to pass that when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring unto their father, Rebekah came unto Jacob, her son, saying: Behold, I did overhear thy father speak unto Esau, thy brother;

5. And your father did say unto him: Bring me venison and make me savory meat, that I may eat and bless thee in the Face{a} of YHVH{b} before my death.
[a] See Shekinah
[b] See YHVH

6. Now, therefore my son, listen to my voice and do according to that which I command thee:

7. Go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth; and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death.

8. And Jacob replied unto Rebekah, his mother, saying: Behold, Esau, my brother, is a hairy man; and I am a smooth man; perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing.

9. And his mother returned to him, saying: Am I not a Priestess of El Elyon{a}, the Most High God? Why should I do this, except YHVH hath bade me; therefore, obey my voice and go fetch me them.
[a] See El Elyon

10. And Jacob went out and fetched the two kid goats and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.

11. And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and she bade Jacob to remove the garments of Adam and Eve that Esau had taken and sold{a} unto him for the soup; and she put the garments of Esau upon Jacob, her younger son;
[a] See 1 Moses 36:34

12. And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck; and she gave the savory meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

13. ¶ And then came Jacob unto his father, saying: My father!

14. And he said, Here am I{a}; Who art thou, which of my sons art thou?
[a] See Hinneh

15. And Jacob lied unto his father, saying: I am Esau, thy firstborn; I have done according as thou asked me.

16. Arise, I pray thee; sit, and eat of this game that I have hunted, that thou should bless me, even unto thy very soul.

17. But Isaac thought he might have been tricked, and asked his son: How is it that thou hast found meat so quickly, my son?

18. And Jacob answered him, saying: YHVH, thy Elohim{a}, brought it to me.
[a] See Elohim

19. And Isaac was not pacified and he said unto Jacob: Come near unto me, I pray thee, and kiss me, that I may feel thee, my son, and by this shall I know if thou be my very son Esau or not.

20. And Jacob came close to his father, Isaac, and kissed him;

21. And Isaac felt him, saying: The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau; and he discerned him not for his hands were hairy as his brother Esau's hands.

22. And Isaac asked him again: Art thou my very son Esau?

23. And Jacob lied a third time, saying: I am.

24. And Isaac did pray unto YHVH in his heart; and he did smell the scent of the raiment his son wore, and said: The smell of my son is as the smell of a field which YHVH hath blessed

25. And being thus pacified, Isaac said: Bring the meat near to me, and I will eat of the venison of my son, I shall bless thee, giving thee a blessing from my very soul unto thy soul.

26. ¶ And Jacob brought the meat near to his father, and Isaac did eat; and Jacob brought him wine, and Isaac drank.

27. And Isaac blessed his son, saying: Ha’Elohim{a} give unto thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and an abundance of grains and wines;
[a] See Ha'Elohim

28. And many tribes shall serve thee, and nations bow down before thee; and thou shall be a lord over thy brethren, and even the sons of thy mother shall bow down to thee and thy seed;

29. And unto those that would curse{a} thee and thy seed shall be accursed, and to those that would bless thee and thy seed shall come a blessing;
[a] Using magic or priestcraft to make nature work against someone

30. And unto thee I do give the keys{a} of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shall bind on the earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatever thou loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens.
[a] The keys to unlocking the kingdom, the 7 keys are thought to be love, repentance, faith, obedience, purpose, fearlessness, and prayer; see Matthew 16:14–19

31. ¶ And it came to pass that Esau, the brother of Jacob, came in from his hunting soon after Isaac did finish blessing Jacob.

32. And Esau also had made a savory meat, and did bring it unto his father, and said unto Isaac: Let my father arise and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

33. And his father, Isaac, did say unto him: Who art thou?

34. And Esau answered him, saying: I am thy son, Esau, thy firstborn.

35. And Isaac trembled very exceedingly and said: Who was it then that had hunted the game, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest? For I did eat and have blessed him; and indeed, he shall be blessed, for this was the will of YHVH in all things.

36. And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father: Bless me, even me also, O my father!

37. And Isaac was saddened and said unto his first born: Thy brother came with subtlety and hath taken away thy blessing, as I knew he should, but in my heart I wished it not so;

38. Yet the will of YHVH has been done, despite the selfish desires of my flesh.

39. And Esau said in his bitterness: Is not he rightly named Jacob? For he hath supplanted me these two times: He took away my birthright; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.

40. And then unto his father he pleaded: Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

41. And Isaac answered his son and said unto Esau: Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren{a} have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him.
[a] Implying that isaac and Rebekah had other children

42. And what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

43. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept before his father, saying: Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.

44. And Isaac, his father, answered and blessed him, saying: Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above; and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother;

45. And it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

chapter-aka: The Ladder

1. And it came to pass that because Jacob had taken the birthright, and the holy garments, and the blessing from Esau that Esau hated Jacob;

2. And because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him, Esau said in his heart: The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.

3. And these words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah by the angel of YHVH{a}, and she sent and called Jacob, her younger son.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

4. ¶ And it came to pass that when Rebekah did see Jacob, she did say unto him: Surely Esau, thy brother, doth comfort his pity by plotting to kill thee!

5. Now, therefore, my son, obey my voice and arise; flee thou to Laban, my brother, to Haran, and tarry with him a few days{a}, until the fury of thy brother subsides;
[a] Or "for a time"

6. For in time shall the anger of thy brother turn away from thee, and he shall forget that which thou hast done to him; then I will send and fetch thee from thence.

7. ¶ And it came to pass that Rebekah went unto her husband, Isaac, saying: I am dreading to my very life that my son might take to marriage of the daughters of Heth;

8. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life be unto me?

9. For have I not taught my sons of YHVH{a}? and these women worship the elohim{b} made of the hands of men.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim of man

10. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, saying unto him: Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan as thy brother Esau hath done.

11. Arise, go to Padan-aram{a}, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother's father, and from amongst these take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of thy mother's brother, Laban.
[a] Aramaic, "the field of Aram;" the patriarch Abraham described these lands as the land of his birth, these were also a people that worshipped idols; see Zohar, Bereshit 1:137a

12. And Elohim Shaddai{a} shall bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou shall be a great company of people,
[a] See Elohim Shaddai

13. And then shall thou be given of Elohim{a} the blessings of our father, Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which Elohim did give us, being the very seed of Abraham.
[a] See Elohim

14. And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel, the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob again, sending him away to Padan-aram to take him a wife from thence,

16. And that their father had blessed him, commanding him, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, and that Jacob obeyed their father and mother and was gone to Padan-aram.

17. And it came to pass that Esau, seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father, went unto the seed of Ishmael with his wives to take unto himself another wife.

18. And it came to pass that Esau took Mahalath, a daughter of Ishmael, a son of Abraham, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife, and she too was not of the Covenant{a}, she being of the seed{b} of Sarah, but not of Abraham{c} as was Isaac, Jacob, and Esau.
[a] See Covenant
[b] Indicating that Hagar was Sarah's daughter
[c] Indicating that Hagar was not of the line in the Abrahamic covenant

19. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob went out from Bearsheba and went toward Haran; and when the sun was set he did find a suitable place to tarried all the night;

20. And he took a certain stone{a} from the ground, placing it beneath his head for a pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep.
[a] Likely a seer stone; see 1 Moses 29:34

21. And it came to pass that he dreamed a dream and beheld a vision: and he saw a ladder set up upon the foundation{a}, stretching from the earth unto the heavens, Yashar-El{b}, even the straight path unto Ha’Elohim{c};
[a] Yesod: Hebrew feminine noun; one of the Sefirot on the Tree of Life
[b] Isreal: straight [to] God; see Yashar-El, Doctrines of the Saints 2g:20-26
[c] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

22. And the ladder had ten and twelve steps, making for twenty-two steps in all:

23. And three of the ten were Mothers and Fathers from which the wind{a} and the fire of the Spirit, and water with its mercy{b} came out;
[a] Or "breath;" see Ruach HaKodesh
[b] Representing Jesus Christ, see John 3:16-17

24. And the other seven of the ten were in duplication, being the seven days and the seven seasons{a};
[a] Or "dispensations"

25. And twelve were the heavens themselves, and were the signs given mankind, and their passions, thrusting forth in all direction{a}.
[a] See Cardinal directions

26. And all these were a tree{a} deeply rooted into the earth and stretching upwards into the heavens:
[a] Likely the Tree of Life

27. And the tree was a flame, yet it did not burn; for this was the fire of the judgment{a}, with the very flames rolling to the North and to the South, and sealed unto the East and the West.
[a] See Gevurah

28. And lo{a}, he did see the malak{b} of Elohim, and even the very Melek Olum{c} ascending and descending the straight path{d}, speaking in the tongues of the cherubim{e}.
[a] See Hinneh
[b] See Malak
[c] Hebrew, " Eternal Holy Man;" likely Jesus Christ
[d] See Yashar El
[e] See Cherubim

29. And behold, YHVH stood above, saying: I am Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh{a}, the Creator{a}; YHVH, the Elohim of Abraham, thy father, and the Elohim of Isaac; the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed:
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

30. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad{a} to the West, and to the East, and to the North, and to the South; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
[a] See Cardinal directions

31. Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee.

32. ¶ And when Jacob awoke from out of his sleep he said: Surely YHVH Elohim{a} is in this place; and I knew it not.
[a] See YHVH Elohim

33. And he was sore afraid and said: How formidable is this place! This is none other but the house of Elohim{a}, and this place is a gate or portal to the heavens!
[a] A temple

34. ¶ And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the seer or holy stone{a} that he had used for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured special oils upon the top of it.
[a] See Seer stone

35. And he named that place Bethel{a}, for that place was the house of Ha’Elohim.
[a] Hebrew, "House of God"

36. And Jacob on that very spot he made an oath, saying: If Elohim will be with me, and will keep{a} me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, that I come again to the house of my father in peace, then shall YHVH be my Elohim;
[a] Watch over; protect

37. And where I place this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be built a temple, the House of Elohim, for YHVH and for El Elyon{a} and for Shekinah{b}:
[a] See El Elyon
[b] See Shekinah

38. And of all that Ha’Elohim shall give me, I will surely give a tenth back unto these.

1. And it came to pass that Jacob continued on his journey until he came into the land of the sons of the east{a}.
[a] The inhabitants of the land eastward from Israel to the Euphrates river; see Jeremiah 49:28

2. And it came to pass that when he arrived in the land of the sons of the east, Jacob looked and beheld a well in the field;

3. And there were three flocks of sheep lying near the well; for the sheep were watered out of that well; and a large stone sat upon the mouth of the well.

4. And the shepherds would gather all the flocks here, and they would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the herds, and then roll the stone again upon the mouth of the well.

5. And Jacob said unto these shepherds: My brethren, from whence are ye?

6. And they replied unto him, saying: From Haran.

7. And Jacob asked them: Know ye Laban, the son of Nahor?

8. And they replied, saying: Yes, we know him.

9. And Jacob asked them: Is he well?

10. And they said: He is well; and behold, here cometh Rachel, his daughter, with the sheep.

11. And Jacob said: Behold, it is yet high day; neither is it time that the flocks should be gathered together; water ye the sheep, and go, and feed them.

12. And they said: We cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and until they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.

13. And while Jacob spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.

14. And it came to pass that when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, the brother of his mother, and their sheep, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the mouth of that well and watered the flock of Laban, the brother of his mother.

15. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept; and he told Rachel that he was a kinsman of her father, and that he was the son of Rebekah; and she ran and told her father.

16. ¶ And it came to pass that when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob, the son of his sister, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house.

17. And Laban looked upon his countenance{a} and said unto him: Surely thou art my bone and my flesh!
[a] Or "visage;" his facial expression

18. ¶ And it came to pass that after Jacob had abode with Laban the space of a month, Laban said unto Jacob: Because thou art my kin, shouldest thou serve me for naught? Tell me, what shall thy reward be?

19. And Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel; and Leah was tender-eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.

20. And Jacob loved Rachel and said: I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.

21. And Laban said unto him: It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob served Laban for seven years for Rachel; yet it seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had for her.

23. And it came to pass that after seven years, Jacob said unto Laban: Give unto me my wife, for my days of serving thee are fulfilled, and I desire that I should be with her.

24. And Laban gathered all the people of the place together and prepared a great feast; but in the evening Laban took Leah, his daughter, and brought her to Jacob; and she went in and lay with him.

25. ¶ And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, Jacob saw that it was Leah that had been given{a} him.
[a] Jacob was tricked into being a polygamy, likely hurt the relationship; see 1 Moses 41:1

26. And he went unto Laban, saying: What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou deceived me?

27. And Laban said: It is not done in our country, to give the younger daughter before the firstborn; therefore, I pray thee, give her this week, and we will give thee Rachel also if thou will covenant{a} thy service unto me yet other seven years.
[a] Laban tricked Jacob so he would honor the marriage covenant to both sisters

28. And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week; and Laban gave him Rachel, his daughter, to wife also; and Jacob went in also and lay with Rachel.

29. And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah, Zilpah, his handmaid, to be a handmaid for her; and Laban gave to Rachel, his younger daughter, Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.

1. And it came to pass that Jacob served Laban yet seven more{a} years, as he had covenanted for Rachel; and Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah.
[a] See 1 Moses 40:27-28

2. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH{a} opened the womb of Leah; yet Rachel was left barren:
[a] See YHVH

3. And Leah conceived and bore a son; and she called his name Reuben{a}; for she said: Surely YHVH hath looked upon my affliction; now, therefore, my husband will love me.
[a] Hebrew: "Behold, a son"

4. ¶ And it came to pass that she conceived again, and bore a son, saying: Because YHVH hath heard that I was unloved, therefore I have been given this son also; and she called his name Simeon{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "That hears or obeys, that is heard"

5. ¶ And it came to pass that she conceived again, and bore a son, saying: Now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have borne him three sons; wherefore was his name called Levi{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "Attached," or "joining"

6. ¶ And she conceived again and bore a son; and she said: Now will I praise YHVH; therefore, she called his name Judah{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "praised" or "praised one"

7. And it came to pass that after this she bore her husband no more sons for a time.

8. ¶ And when Rachel saw that she could bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob: Give me children, or else I shall die!

9. And the anger of Jacob was kindled against Rachel; and he said: Am I in the place of Elohim{a}, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
[a] See Elohim

10. And she said unto her husband: Behold my handmaid Bilhah; go in and lie with her; and she shall bear thy seed, that I may also have children by her.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that Rachel gave Jacob Bilhah, her handmaid, to wife; and Jacob went and lay with her; and Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.

12. And Rachel said: Elohim hath judged my case, and hath heard my voice, and hath given me a son; wherefore she called his name Dan{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "judge"

13. ¶ And it came to pass that Bilhah, the handmaid of Rachel, conceived again and bore Jacob a second son; and Rachel said: With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed; and she called his name Naphtali{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "my wrestling"

14. ¶ And it came to pass that when Leah saw that she was not bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her unto Jacob to wife.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Zilpah bore Jacob a son; and Leah said: A troop cometh; and they called his name Gad{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "Happiness, Luck, Fortune"

16. ¶ And it came to pass that Zilpah bore Jacob a second son; and Leah said: Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed; and they called his name Asher{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "happiness" or "blessed"

17. ¶ And it came to pass that Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.

18. Then Rachel said to Leah: Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

19. And Leah said unto her: Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? And wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?

20. And Rachel said: Therefore, he shall lie with thee tonight for the mandrakes of thy son.

21. And Jacob came out of the field in the evening; and Leah went out to meet him and said: Thou must come in and lie with me; for surely I have hired thee with the mandrakes of my son.

22. And Jacob lay with Leah, his first wife, that night; and God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.

23. And it came to pass that Leah said: God hath given me my hire because I have given my handmaid to my husband; and she called his name Issachar{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "reward"

24. ¶ And it came to pass that Leah conceived again and bore Jacob the sixth son; and Leah said: Elohim hath endowed me with a good dowry;

25. Now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons; and she called his name Zebulun{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "prince"

26. ¶ And it came to pass that afterwards she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "judged" or "vindicated’

27. ¶ And it came to pass that Elohim remembered Rachel, and hearkened to her and opened her womb; and she conceived, and bore a son, and said: Elohim hath taken away my shame!

28. And she called his name Joseph{a}, and it is this same Joseph, even our very father, that should be sent by YHVH unto Egypt and that should save Israel, the people of YHVH; and this is the record of his people, even unto this day.

chapter-aka: Flocks and Flight

1. And it came to pass that when Rachel had borne our father, Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban: Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place and to my country.

2. And give unto me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go; for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

3. And Laban spoke unto him, saying: I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry; for I have seen that YHVH{a} hath blessed me for thy sake; therefore appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
[a] See YHVH

4. And Jacob said unto him: Thou knowest how I have served thee and how thy flocks were with me, for it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and Ha’Elohim{a} hath blessed thee since my coming.
[a] Hebrew "the gods;" this may have been used because Laban worshipped other gods; See Ha'Elohim, Elohim of man

5. And now, behold, when shall I provide for mine own house also?

6. And Laban asked again: What shall I give thee?

7. And Jacob answered him, saying: Thou shalt not give me anything; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.

8. I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and of such shall be my hire.

9. So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face;

10. And every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted as thine.

11. And Laban covenanted with him, saying: Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.

12. And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

13. And Laban set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of the flocks of Laban.

14. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chestnut tree, and pilled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.

15. And he prayed over the rods, blessing{a} them as to make them holy, and set the rods before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they that came to drink should conceive in abundance.
[a] By blessing the rods he made them holy objects; see 4 Moses 32:22-40, Avahr 18:13

16. ¶ And it came to pass that the flocks that came before the rods, these did conceive, and they brought forth cattle ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted, even as he had prayed.

17. And Jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ring-streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto the herds of Laban.

18. ¶ And it came to pass that whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods that had been blessed of the power of YHVH before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.

19. But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in; and so it was that the feebler were beloging to Laban, and the stronger to Jacob;

20. And because of this, Jacob increased exceedingly and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and sheep, and camels, and asses.

21. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away all that was belonging to our father; and of that which was once beloning to our father hath he gotten all this glory.

22. And thus did Jacob behold that the righteous countenance{a} of Laban had fallen{b}, and behold, it was not towards Jacob anymore.
[a] Or "the favor in his sight"
[b] Or "had gone away," or "had left him"

23. And the angel of YHVH{a} came unto Jacob, saying: Return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred; and YHVH will be with thee.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

24. And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, and he said unto them: I see that your father's countenance as fallen, that it is not toward me as before; but the Elohim{a} of my father hath been with me:
[a] See Elohim

25. And ye know that with all my power I have served your father, and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times; but Elohim has intervened that he could not hurt me.

26. And if he said thus: The speckled shall be thy wages, then all the cattle bare speckled; and if he said thus: The ringstreaked shall be thy hire, then bare all the cattle ring-streaked; and even so Elohim hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me.

27. And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream; and lo, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were all ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.

28. And the angel of Ha’Elohim spoke unto me in a dream, saying: Jacob!

29. And I said: Here am I.

30. And the angel said: Lift up now thine eyes and see, for all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

31. I have been sent by Ha’El of Bethel{a}, where thou anointed the pillar and where thou vowed a vow unto YHVH; now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
[a] Hebrew, "the God of the House of God," or "the God over the temple," or "the God over this house"

32. ¶ And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him: Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in the house of our father? Are we not counted of him strangers?

33. For our father hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our dowry; and all the riches which Elohim hath taken from our father was to be ours and for our children;

34. Therefore, whatsoever Ha’Elohim hath said unto thee thou must do, and we, thy wives, are with thee, our husband.

35. Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels; and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten; the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

chapter-aka: A Covenant of Peace

1. And it came to pass that when Laban went out to shear his sheep he saw that some of the elohim{a} made by the hands of man were gone, for so it was that Rachel had stolen the images that did belong to her father;
[a] See Elohim of man

2. And he saw too that Jacob had snuck away while Laban was unaware, in that he told him not that he intended to flee.

3. And Jacob and his family and their people fled with all that they had, all that belonged to them, and the idols Rachel had taken unaware to Jacob and Laban.

4. And seeing this, it came to pass that on the third day after Jacob had fled, Laban rose up, and he took his kinsmen with him and pursued after Jacob;

5. And they passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead, and it came to pass that after seven days' journey, and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

6. But behold, in that very same night, the fear of Elohim{a} came to Laban in a dream, saying unto him: Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
[a] See Elohim

7. ¶ And now it came to pass that the next morning, Laban overtook Jacob.

8. And Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount; and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

9. And Laban said to Jacob: What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword?

10. Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tambourine, and with harp?

11. And why hast thou not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters{a}? Thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
[a] His grandchildren

12. It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the Elohim of thy father spoke unto me yesternight, saying: Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

13. And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods{a}?
[a] Hebrew, "elohim;" see 1 Moses 43:3; Elohim of man

14. And Jacob answered and said to Laban: It was because I was afraid; for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.

15. With whomsoever thou findest thy elohim{a}, let him not live; before our kinsmen discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.
[a] Hebrew, "gods;" see Elohim of man

16. And Jacob said this thinking nothing had been taken falsely from Laban, for he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols hoping that she should bear her husband more sons.

17. ¶ And Laban went first into the tent of Jacob, and then into the tent of Zilpah, and into the tent of Bilhah, and into the tent of Leah; but he found them not.

18. And then, when he had gone out of the tent of Leah, he entered into the tent of Rachel; and Rachel, who had taken the images and put them in the saddle of a camel and sat upon them.

19. And she said to her father: Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women{a} is upon me.
[a] Menstruation, her menstrual cycle

20. And Laban searched all the tent save it be where she sat but he found them not.

21. And he searched all over and roundabout the camp, but he found not the images.

22. ¶ And Jacob was angry and rebuked Laban, saying: What is my trespass? What is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

23. And see now that thou hast searched all my things, and what hast thou found of all thy household? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

24. This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

25. That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.

26. Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

27. Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle; and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

28. Except the Elohim of my father, the Elohim of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty.

29. Ha’Elohim{a} hath seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

30. ¶ And Laban answered and said unto Jacob: These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine;

31. And what can I do this day unto these, my daughters, or unto their children, which they have borne?

32. Now, therefore, come thou; let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

33. And Jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar.

34. And Jacob said unto their kinsmen: Gather stones; and they took stones and made a pillar; and they did eat there upon the it.

35. And Laban called it Yegar Sahadutha{a}; but Jacob called it Galed{b}.
[a] Hebrew: "stones of the testimony"
[b] Hebrew: "witness pile"

36. ¶ And Laban said: This mound shall be a witness between me and thee this day;

37. And the name of it is also the Watchtower, Mitspah{a}, for Laban said: YHVH{b} watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another;
[a] Hebrew: "watchtower"  
[b] See YHVH

38. But if thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, Elohim is witness betwixt me and thee:

39. Behold this pillar, which I have cast between me and thee; it is a witness that I will not pass over this mound to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this pillar unto me for harm;

40. The Elohim of Abraham, and the Elohim of Nahor, the Elohim of their father, judge betwixt us.

41. ¶ And Jacob swore by the fear of the Elohim of his father, Isaac.

42. And then Jacob offered a sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mount.

43. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters{a}, and blessed them; and then Laban departed and returned unto his home.

1. And it came to pass that after Jacob had gone on his way from Galed that the malakim{a} of Elohim{b} met him.
[a] See Malak
[b] See Elohim

2. And when Jacob saw them, he said: Herein dwell the hosts of Elohim.

3. And he called the name of that place Machanayim{a}, for he saw that it was a bridge joining the two worlds: the heavens and the earth, and that he and his people were protected by the hand of Ha’Elohim{b}.
[a] Hebrew: "two camps"
[b] See Ha'Elohim

4. ¶ And Jacob, in knowing this, he did send messengers before him to Esau, his brother, unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

5. And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak unto my lord{a} Esau: Thy servant Jacob saith thus: I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now;
[a] Adon: Hebrew, "lord."

6. And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and women servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.

7. ¶ And it came to pass that the messengers returned unto Jacob, saying: We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

8. Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands.

9. ¶ And after this Jacob said: If Esau comes to the one company and smites them, then the other company which is left shall escape.

10. And then Jacob did pray aloud, saying: O Elohim of my father Abraham, and Elohim of my father Isaac; YHVH, which did say unto me: Return unto thy country and to thy kindred, and I will be good by thee:

11. Yet I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this, and now I am become two bands.

12. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, even from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me and the mothers with their children.

13. And for a surety thou hath said: I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

14. ¶ And he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau, his brother:

15. Two hundred she goats and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

16. Thirty milking camels with their colts, forty heifers and ten bulls, twenty she asses and ten foals.

17. And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves, and said unto his servants: Pass over before me and put a space between the droves.

18. And he commanded the foremost, saying: When Esau, my brother, shall meet thee and ask thee, saying: Whose art thou? And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee?

19. Then thou shalt say: They belongeth to Jacob, thy servant; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau; and behold, also he is behind us.

20. And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau when ye find him.

21. And say ye, moreover: Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.

22. For he said: I will appease him with the present that shall go before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.

23. ¶ So went the present over before him; and he himself slept that night in the company.

24. And he rose up that night and took his wives and his children, and these passed over the ford of Yabboq{a}; and he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent them over with that which he had.
[a] Likely a river east of the Jordan river

25. And then it was that Jacob was left alone.

1. And it came to pass that there came unto him a man who was not a man{a}, and he sat and spoke to Jacob all the night;
[a] Likely a name for God; see 1 Moses 45:13

2. And Jacob wrestled with himself over the things he had done, for both good and evil, until the breaking of the day, for he feared that death would come to him by the hand of his brother, Esau.

3. And when the man who was not a man saw that he prevailed not towards Jacob, he touched the hollow of his own thigh; and the hollow of the thigh of Jacob was out of joint as he wrestled with himself, and he was awakened by the pain of it.

4. ¶ And he who was a man but not a man said: And now I must go, for the day breaketh.

5. But Jacob implored him, saying: I cannot let thee go from before me, except thou bless me.

6. And he asked him: What is thy name, I pray thee?

7. And he replied unto him: Jacob.

8. And he who is a man but not a man blessed him, saying: Thy new name shall be Israel{a}; for thou hast struggled with Ha’Elohim{b} and with men and have been given power of both;
[a] See Yashar-El
[b] Hebrew, "gods;" see Ha'Elohim

9. And thy children shall too be called such so long as they stay upon my straight path;

10. For the righteous are blessed and they are those to whom the Holy One shall cause to see visions and to dream dreams;

11. Therefore, be wise and know that in dreams Adam{a} is forewarned and preserved from judgments and calamities, for the soul may speak to the flesh in the time of sleep.
[a] Hebrew, "mankind"

12. ¶ And Jacob asked him: Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.

13. And he who is a man but is not a man said: Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? But it is Ben Ahman{a}, the very Son of Ahman{b}.
[a] Hebrew, "Ben Awmen" (אמן בן), "Son of Ahman," or "Son of Awmen;" a name for Jesus Christ, see Doctrines of the Saints 45b:3-4, Son Awmen
[b] Hebrew, "Ahman" or "Awmen" (אמן), (name of God; see Doctrines of the Saints 45b; Awmen

14. And there in that place where Ben Ahman did bless him, Jacob called the name of it Penuel{a}, saying: I have seen Elohim face to face{b}, and my life is preserved.
[a] Hebrew, "Face of God"
[b] A pun or sorts, as this is another way of saying "the Glory of God was upon him or her"

15. ¶ And as Jacob passed over Penuel{a}, the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
[a] Hebrew, "Face of God"

16. And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked; and behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men.

17. And Jacob had divided the children unto his wives, their mothers: unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto Bilhah, and unto Zilpah.

18. And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph, even our father, hindermost to keep them safe.

19. And Jacob passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that Esau ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept.

21. And Esau lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said: Who are these with thee?

22. And Jacob answered him, saying: The children which Ha’Elohim hath graciously given thy servant.

23. Then the two wives of Jacob that had been given him of Rachel and Leah came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.

24. And Leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves; and after came our humble father, Joseph, and our mother, Rachel; and they bowed themselves.

25. ¶ And Esau asked him: What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?

26. And Jacob said: These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

27. And Esau said: I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.

28. And Jacob replied, saying: Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive these, my gifts at my hand; for when I saw the face of Elohim, my only request was to know that thou wast pleased with me.

29. And Esau accepted the gifts, and offered unto Jacob gifts also, saying: Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee because Elohim hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough; and Esau urged him, and Jacob took it.

30. ¶ And Esau said: Behold, our father doth yet live; therefore, let us take our journey together unto him; yea, let us go and I will go before thee.

31. And Jacob said unto him: My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me; and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

32. Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant; and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord again.

33. And Esau said: Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me.

34. And Jacob said: What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.

35. And so Esau returned that day on his way, leaving his brother and went not unto their father.

chapter-aka: The Gift or The Endowment

1. And it came to pass that Jacob journeyed with his people unto Isaac, his father, unto that place where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

2. ¶ And it came to pass that Isaac, his father, met Jacob and his wives there and he blessed them.

3. And Isaac endowed{a} Jacob and his wives{b} with the very power{c} Melchizedek had given Abraham, and Abraham had given Isaac.
[a] Hebrew, "gift," from the Hebrew, "Zabad," "endow with" or "to bestow upon;" see Endowment
[b] "and his wives" added by revelation
[c] See 1 Moses 27

4. And blessing him, Isaac said: Thy name is Jacob; thy new name shall be Israel{a}; and this shall be given thee for a sign and token that all might know the peoples of YHVH Elohim{b}.
[a] See Yashar-El
[b] See YHVH Elohim

5. And Isaac blessed him further, saying: Elohim Shaddai{a} shall bless thee; therefore, be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come from out of thy loins;
[a] See Elohim Shaddai

6. And the endowment which YHVH Elohim gave thy fathers Abraham and Isaac, to thee will it be given, and to thy seed after thee shall be given the land, as they are worthy of it.

7. And these gifts{a} shall be of great worth because they are from the very foundation of the Torah{b} of Elohim YHVH, and by the Torah are all things governed;
[a] See Endowment
[b] Hebrew "Teachings," "Instructions," or "Law"

8. As mankind{a} is willing to learn the Torah, the world shall endure, therefore observe the trees at the evening of the day, and the dawn of the morn:
[a] Hebrew, "Adam"

9. And this is when Shekinah{a} shall love thee and this is when Ruach HaKodesh{b} might place thee in the garden of Eden{c} of the very heavens, to converse with thee in righteousness.
[a] See Shekinah
[b] See Ruach HaKodesh
[c] See Eden

10. And all the trees in the grove of Shekinah rejoice and chant their praises to the glory of Her, and of Her Husband, and of their Son, the Yachad Yachid Echad{a}:
[a] See Yachad Yachid Echad  

11. And there is one Elohim{a} above all, and YHVH{b} shall wear the crown{c} in the day that death shall be defeated{d}.
[a] See Elohim
[b] See YHVH
[c] See Keter
[d] See Isaiah 25:8; Hosea 13:14; Mosiah 8:81 RAV, 16:8 OPV; 1 Corinthians 15:24-26;

12. And one is below all these things, and seeks to destroy the soul of mankind, even as it is born of the flesh and spirit in the Mercy{a} of YHVH Elohim.
[a] Chesed: Hebrew, "mercy," feminine noun; one of the Sefirot on the Tree of Life; See Chesed

13. And there is one that shall stand between the two; the Ruach HaKodesh that stands between the soul and spirit to pass Judgment{a} on mankind.
[a] Din: Hebrew, "judgement;" here representing Gevurah, Hebrew, "strength;" see Gevurah

14. And through the Judgment two beget a third, the soul is born and lives to love the Eternal Torah of Ha’Elohim.

15. And the spirit and the flesh and the soul, these three become one man or one woman; and this one is thus belonging to the kingdom of YHVH Elohim;

16. And as one, Adam{a} made whole, shines forth the divine light of life.
[a] See Adam Elyon

17. And through the light that is poured out the visible heavens and the earth are again united:

18. One becomes two, which becomes three, which are one, shining in all six directions, rising in twelve, reaching the heavens.

19. And from twelve become twenty-four, yet only twenty-two are seen by mankind; and in these were all things created by Ha’Elohim.

20. Therefore, sleep not my son, for if thou shalt sleep thou will know these things not, for those that sleep are blind to the creation.

21. And what shall happen when thou shall be in the presence of the great judge of Ha’Elohim? For all must answer to their deeds.

22. And when the flesh shall be taken, the soul shall flee to Ha’Elohim on high, and if the Torah be fulfilled then the gates of heaven remain opened to them.

23. ¶ And after this, Jacob pondered over all he had seen, and pondered over these things his father, Isaac, had blessed him with:

24. And as he did, the angel of YHVH{a} appeared unto him, and made a covenant with him, and kissed his head, and called him by name, calling him: friend{b}.
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] Can also mean "companion" or "lover"

25. And as it is written in the Testament of Jacob, the angel of YHVH completed the covenant with him and with his seed forever, who are all they that believe on YHVH Elohim in righteousness.

26. And the Ruach Hakodesh went up from Isaac, and the angel of YHVH looked on.

27. ¶ And it came to pass that but a few days thence, Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him;

28. And before Isaac died, he had reached the hundred and eightieth degree.

chapter-aka: Life and Death

1. And now it came to pass that on the morrow the angel of YHVH{a} said unto Jacob: Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto that Elohim{b} that appeared{c} unto thee when thou feared the face of Esau, thy brother.
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] See Elohim
[c] See 1 Moses 45

2. Then Jacob said unto his all household and to all that were with him: Put away the strange gods{a} that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments;
[a] See Elohim of man

3. Let us arise and go up to Bethel; and there I will make an altar unto Ha’Elohim{a} who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went.
[a] See Ha' Elohim

4. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods{a} which were in their hands and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob buried them in an empty and barren field which was near Shechem.
[a] Or "idols;" see Elohim of man

5. And they journeyed; and the terror of Ha’Elohim was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that as they journeyed to Bethel they were but a little way from Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, but she was with child and she had great difficulty in her labor.

7. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife, Deborah, said unto her: Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

8. And it came to pass, as her soul was departing, that she called his name Ben-oni{a}; but his father called his name Benjamin{b}.
[a] Hebrew, "son of my sorrow"
[b] Hebrew, "Binyamin;" "son of the right hand"

9. And Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath; and Jacob wept and set a pillar upon her grave.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob came to Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

11. And there he built an altar and called the place El-Bethel because there Ha’Elohim appeared unto him when he fled{a} from the face of his brother.
[a] See 1 Moses 45

12. ¶ And it came to pass that Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, died; and she was buried in Bethel under an oak{a}, for she had been a mighty woman of YHVH{b} and a servant of Shekinah{c};
[a] See Allah
[b] See YHVH
[c] See Shekinah 

13. And in the grove near the tree the women built a dwelling place{a} for to honor Her, the Shekinah, and planted walnuts{b} and certain flowers; and they did dance all around it.
[a] Hebrew, bayith matstsebeth; "house" or "temple" (bayith) and "monument" or "pillar" (matstsebeth); maybe a type of minor temple
[b] Walnuts have ties to Asherah worship, and there is evidence that Asherah was seen as the wife of YHVH and was a goddess edited out of the modern Bible after Judea became monotheistic

14. And Jacob set up a pillar in that same grove, in the place where he talked with Ben Ahman{a}, even a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
[a] See 1 Moses 45; Awmen

15. And in these things which they did, both the men and the women; and YHVH Elohim was pleased.

16. ¶ And Jacob called the name of the place where Elohim spoke with him Bethel.

17. And there, at the altar, Jacob blessed his wife, Leah, with the same endowments{a} he had been given; and she his other wives each in turn, and Dinah, the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob.
[a] See 1 Moses 46:5-6

18. And so to did Jacob bless their sons, even as they came of age, and each was given their endowments in turn.

19. ¶ And now, the sons of Leah were: Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;

20. And the sons of Rachel were: Joseph, our father, and Benjamin;

21. And the sons of Bilhah were: Dan and Naphtali;

22. And the sons of Zilpah were: Gad and Asher.

23. And these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him and his wives.

24. ¶ And it came to pass that Jacob took his wives, all but Rachel who he had buried, and his children and his people and all that they possessed and journeyed to Sukkoth{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "booths" or "tents"

25. And there he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem; and he erected there an altar and called it El’Elohim’Ysrael{a}.
[a] Hebrew: "the God of Gods over Israel" or "the God of Gods over the straight path [to] God"

26. And he built him a house, and made booths for his cattle; therefore, the name of the place is called Sukkoth.
