chapter-aka: Ten and Seven Flames
chapter-sum: Zenos, lost in the wilderness, prepares for death, but instead sees the angel of the Lord and is given a vision of God.

1. And in the day that I, Zenos, did find myself alone in the wilderness, being driven off course, for I did wonder many days alone;

2. And it came to pass that in the day that I had lost all hope for the salvation of my life, I did pray into YHVH{a} for the forgiveness of my sins and for the salvation of my eternal soul. 
[a] YHVH: also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD.

3. Yea, and I did pour my heart out unto YHVH for my family, yea even for the sake of my wife and children, yea and for my friends and my neighbors, 

4. Yea, and for my servants, and for the strangers that did come to dwell among us in the land, and even for those that hateth me; 

5. Yea, and I did pray for all mankind, that my soul might be pure before YHVH, for the Torah{b} doth proclaim{c}: Hear, O Israel: YHVH is our Elohim{d}, YHVH is Unity.
[b] Torah: Hebrew meaning Instructions, Teachings, or Law.
[c] See Deuteronomy 6:4.
[d] Elohim: “Gods.” Can denote the Godhead or Trinity as a whole, God the Father & Mother, or the Masculine and Feminine aspects of God.

6. And so too doth the Torah proclaim{e}: And thou shalt love YHVH thy Elohim with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. 
[e] See Deuteronomy 6:5.

7. Holy ye shall be{f} for I, YHVH Elohim{g}, am holy. 
[f] Be: or “become,” see Leviticus 11:44.
[g] YHVH Elohim: YHVH is also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. Elohim translates to “gods” and is both male and female: “El,” Hebrew for “god” is masculine, while “Eloh” is Hebrew for goddess, and “im” is masculine. Thus “Elohim may be male and female as a word with a feminine singular and a masculine plural. YHVH Elohim is typically translated as “the LORD God,” and may denote that YHVH is a part of the Elohim collective “One God.”

8. Every{h} man and every woman shall fear and respect their Mother the earth, and their Father in the Heavens, for these are the Creator, and ye, their creation, shall keep my Sabbaths; I am YHVH thy Elohim. 
[h] From an unknown part of the Torah, likely in one of the 5 Books of Moses on these plates of brass. See Exodus 20:8. 12; Book of the Law of the Lord 1:13-18, 27-33.

9. Be not adulterers{i}, turning unto idols, neither make unto yourselves molten gods, for I am YHVH thy Elohim. 
[i] Adultery: Hebrew masculine noun, usually refers to a man having sex or a sexual relationship with a married woman; also used to describe the worship of idols as God views our relationship/covenant with Him as a marriage covenant.

10. And when ye shall make thy peace offerings{j} in sacrifice unto YHVH, ye shall offer it at your own will that I might find them acceptable to me. 
[j] See Exodus 25:2.

11. And the Torah doth say{k} also: If a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him; but the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, 
[k] See Leviticus 19:33-34. 

12. And thou shalt love them as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt, and I am YHVH, your Elohim. 

13. And the Torah doth say{l} also: Ye shall observe all my ordinances and all my customs, and do them; I am YHVH.
[l] See Leviticus 19:37. 

14. ¶ And it came to pass that after I had prayed, being prepared to return to that Elohim who did create me, I beheld that the angel of YHVH{m} came to me saying: I am come being sent from YHVH, 
[m] Angel of YHVH: a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH. See Doctrines of the Saints 45e.

15. Mercy{n} be unto thee, and shalom{o}, from He that is, and eternally was, and shall come in the flesh; 
[n] Chen or hen: Hebrew (חן) an undeserved “grace,” “mercy,” or “favor.” 
[o] Shalom: Hebrew, “peace.”

16. And from the seven malak{p} who are cherubim{q} which are called to stand before His throne, saying: Unto YHVH be glory and dominion forever and ever! So mote it be, Amen! 
[p] Malak: Arabic and Hebrew for “messenger,” or angel.”
[q] Cherubim: Hebrew form Akkadian meaning “one who blesses;” a type of angel.

17. And this they say, for when YHVH shall come with in the flesh His friends shall wound him, and shall pierce him through:

18. And when He shall descend from the clouds every eye shall see Him, and all the blood of man upon the earth shall wail, whether with joy in their faith or in sorrow of their sins. So mote it be, Amen!

19. ¶ And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH gave unto me a scroll, saying: Take thee this scroll and eat it, for it is thy mitzvah{r} from YHVH unto thee.
[r] Mitzvah: Hebrew, calling, commandment, or religious duty.

20. And I took it, and I ate of it, and it was bitter, and the pain of it was bitter, yet it was also sweet, as it were honey upon my tongue.

21. ¶ And it came to pass that having eaten the scroll, when the angel of YHVH spoke, my eyes were opened and I heard as it were a loud voice, as the sound of a shofar, saying: I am Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh{s}, and I have called thee and set thee apart;
[s] Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh: The Creator, or “I AM that I AM,” or “I AM (the One) that Makes/Creates.”

22. Therefore, write what I shall show unto thee; and it is for thy seed, and for thy brothers, even the seed of Joseph and of Manasseh; and of Ephraim 

23. And thy words shall be written down and you shall go forth and warn my people; and these words which thou shall write, they shall be lost unto the world, 

24. But these words shall not be lost unto me, for I shall keep them and preserve them; and at the Last Days they shall be brought forth to teach mine Israel; 

25. Therefore, read these, my words, unto thy brethren and unto thy seed, and declare teshuvah{t} in my name unto all the land that mine peoples might be spared.
[t] Teshuvah: (תשובה) “return.” Christ is the way back to God, usually translated as “repentance,” “redemption,” or “grace.”

26. And say thou unto them: That I shall spare them not should they come not to me in teshuvah.

27. ¶ And I say unto thee, Zenos: That mine peoples shall reject me, and this must be that they be scattered to the four winds, that the blood of my chosen people should cover all the earth. 

28. And it came to pass that after the angel of YHVH had finished speaking I fell at his feet to worship him,

29. And the angel of YHVH said unto me: Standest thou, and worship me not, for I am the angel of YHVH; therefore, worship Elohim in the spirit of revelation and prophecy.

30. ¶ And it came to pass that as I turned to see the voice that spake unto me, the angel of YHVH was gone from before me;

31. And in his place, I saw as it were ten and seven flames; and from these seven burned more brightly than the others; 

32. And in the midst of these I saw one who was like unto the Son of Man, clothed with in garments from His crown{u} to his feet which touched the earth{v};
[u] Keter: Hebrew “the crown,” Egyptian “the All;” referring to the Sefirot topmost on the Tree of Life. In the middle line, the Pillar of Balance. The Sefirot represents the infinite nature of God.
[v] Malchuth: Hebrew: “kingdom.” The tenth of the sephirot in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It sits at the bottom of the Tree, below Yesod. This sephirah has as a symbol the Bride which relates to the sphere of Tif’eret, symbolized by the Bridegroom.

33. And girt about the chest{w} with a girdle of gold, his heart being anointed;
[w] Binah: Hebrew, “understanding;” intuitive understanding, or contemplation. In Mormon Kabbalah, the location or mystical state where all ten sefirot in the Tree of Life are united as one. Binah is the hidden sefirot located below Keter in the middle column, between Da’at, Chokhmah, Chesed, and Gevurah. Though Binal we can glimpse the infinity of Keter. 

34. And His eyes were full of wisdom{x} and knowledge{y}, as they were flames of fire; 
[x] Chokhmah: Hebrew, “wisdom.” Chokhmah is the top most Sefirot on the right line in the Kabbalistic tree of life, the Pillar of Mercy. In traditional Kabbalah it represents the right eye, in Mormon Kabbalah it represents the Divine Feminine or Heavenly Mother. 
[y] Da’at: Hebrew, “knowledge.” In Mormon Kabbalah, Da’at is the top most Sefirot on the left line of the Kabbalistic tree of life, the Pillar of Severity. In traditional Kabbalah, this spot is the left eye, in Mormon Kabbalah it represents the Divine Masculine, or Heavenly Father. 

35. And his feet{z} were as eternal glory, never departing to the right nor to the left, but ever forward;
[z] Hod and Netzach: Hod, Hebrew, “majesty,” “glory,” or “splendor.” Hod rests at the bottom of the left pillar on the tree of life, and is known as the left foot. Netzach, Hebrew “eternity.” Netzach is located at the bottom of the left pillar on the tree of life. Hod and Netzach represent motion. 

36. And in his right hand was mercy{aa}, and in his left judgment{bb}; 
[aa] Chesed: Hebrew, mercy,” representing God’s love, mercy, and devotional piety toward mankind. In traditional Kabbalah, Chesed represents the right hand of God, in Mormon Kabbalah this Sefirot represents Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

[bb] Gevurah: Hebrew, “strength.” Located in the center of the left column, Gevurah represents the left hand of God. In Mormon Kabbalah this sefirot represents the Holy Ghost and judgment. With the mercy of Christ Gevurah becomes a cleaning and transforming fire, without it Gevurah becomes hellfire damning us. 

37. And his countenance{cc} was as the sun shineth in his strength;
[cc] Yeshod: Hebrew, “foundation.” In traditional Kabbalah, Yeshod foundation of God’s creation serving as a sort of transmitter between the heavens above and the earth below. Combining the masculine and feminine, Yeshod represents the bosom or the genitals. 

38. And I saw as it were seven stars come from out of his mouth, and each of these held in their hands and in their mouths a sharp two-edged sword.

39. And when I saw Him, I fell back to the earth and trembled.

40. ¶ And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH spoke unto me again, saying: Fear not; for what thou beholdeth is תא Aleph-Tav; the beginning and the end, the Creator and His Creation; and in Him are the keys of sheol{dd};
[dd] Sheol: Hebrew feminine noun, “grave” or “sepulcher.” Originally the grave but became to be known as the afterlife. While some today see this term to mean “hell,” it would not have had this meaning until the Second Temple period, after Lehi left Jerusalem. 

41. And I shall tell thee of the vision thou hast seen, of the things which were, and that are, and shall come to pass, and thou shall write it;

42. For the mystery of the seven flames are the seven angels of the seven dispensations which ruleth over the seven days of YHVH.

chapter-aka: Temple of Heaven
chapter-sum: Zenos is given another vision explaining his vision of God, he sees the heavens as they prepare the earth.

1. And it came to pass that after the angel of YHVH{a} had spoken I looked, and I beheld a window opening in the heavens, 
[a] Angel of YHVH: a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH.

2. And the voice which I had heard like that of a shofar spoke again unto me, saying: Come thou, and ye shall see that thou might understand that vision of which thou hast seen, 

3. Yea, come and see that thou mayest know that which came before, and that which must be. 

4. And I was taken away in the spirit, and I beheld as it were a throne in the heavens, and a Man{b} and a Woman{c} who sat upon the throne;
[b] Awmen: God the Father, or “divine man.” See Doctrines of the Saints 45b:1.
[c] Shekinah: “The Presence,” or “the dwelling place of God.” A term used to describe the Divine Feminine or the Spirit of Heavenly Mother. Through the Divine Feminine God receives from us, our prayers and supplication. Also known as the Hai. See Book of Remembrance 2:11.

5. And They had in one hand a great sapphire{d} upon which was written the Torah{e} and in the other a great emerald{f} upon which were written the mysteries of the temple;
[d] Sapphire: According to Jewish legends, the Torah or 10 Commandments were written on sapphire. Adam and Eve were given a staff with a sapphire tip, according to the Midrash, which made its way to Moses and he used it to perform miracles. Sefirot comes from Safire, and so some believe the “sapphire” represent the Sefirot of the tree of life,and so the secrets of Kabbalah. Blue is the color of holiness and divinity. The tzitzits (“frenge”) have blue in them to represent that Israel is a kingdom of priests and priestesses, blue reminding also of the sapphire. 
[e] Torah: Hebrew meaning Instructions, Teachings, or Law.
[f] Emerald: Hebrew nophek, a precious stone maybe emerald or turquoise. This gemstone is an ancient symbol of abundance. It is used to represent the divine flow and union between the Creator and the creation. Green is also associated with the Sefirot Tif’eret, Hebrew “adornment.” This Sefirot is in the middle column, the Pillar of balance, below Keter and Binah (in the Mormon Kabbalah tree of life) and above Malkut and Yesod. Tif’eret is associated with spirituality, balance, integration, beauty, and miracles. 

6. And round Their throne I saw as it were twenty-four smaller thrones, and upon these sat twenty-four elders, clothed in their purity and prepared to be sent forth as instructed by YHVH{g};
[g] YHVH: also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. See Doctrines of the Saints 45e.

7. And out of these I saw as it were lightnings and thunderings coming forth, and these were the voices of the seven fires burning before the throne, which are the seven angels of the seven dispensations.

8. ¶ And before the throne I saw as it were the great urim and thummim{h},where upon the eyes of Elohim{i} rests;
[h] Urim and Thummim: Hebrew “Lights and Perfections." A holy or sacred device for divining oracles. This may refer to a seer stone, something similar to what Joseph Smith Jr. used or the bow with stones as the Nephites had and Joseph Smith Jr. used to translate the lost 116 pages of the Book of Mormon, or something else entirely. See Exodus 28:30; Leviticus 8:8; Numbers 27:21; Deuteronomy 33:8; Ezra 2:63; Mosiah 5:72-75, 8:13 OPV; Ether 1:88-93 RAV, 3:23- 28 OPV; Avahr 7:34, 24:28, 39:2).
[i] Elohim: “Gods.” Can denote the Godhead or Trinity as a whole, God the Father & Mother, or the Masculine and Feminine aspects of God.

9. And all about the thrones were four beasts whose eyes saw before and behind by the means of the great urim and thummim:

10. And the first beast was like a lion, being as it were the fire of judgment{j}, and standing towards the South{k};
[j] Gevurah: Hebrew, “strength.” Located in the center of the left column, Gevurah represents the left hand of God. In Mormon Kabbalah this sefirot represents the Holy Ghost and judgment. With the mercy of Christ Gevurah becomes a cleaning and transforming fire, without it Gevurah becomes hellfire damning us.
[k] South represents the fire of God’s judgment, the Holy Spirit.

11. And the second beast was like an ox, being as it were the earth grounded in wisdom{l}, and standing towards the North{m};
[l] Chokhmah: Hebrew, “wisdom.” Chokhmah is the top most Sefirot on the right line in the Kabbalistic tree of life, the Pillar of Mercy. In traditional Kabbalah it represents the right eye, in Mormon Kabbalah it represents the Divine Feminine or Heavenly Mother.
[m] North represents the wisdom of the Divine Feminine, Heavenly Mother, the Shekinah. 

12. And the third beast wore the face of a man, being as it were the waters flowing in mercy{n} and standing towards the East{o};
[n] Chesed: Hebrew, mercy,” representing God’s love, mercy, and devotional piety toward mankind. In traditional Kabbalah, Chesed represents the right hand of God, in Mormon Kabbalah this Sefirot represents Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[o] East represents the mercy of Jesus Christ, the covenant and the atonement.

13. And the fourth beast was like an eagle in flight, being as it were in the air with heavenly knowledge{p} and standing towards the West{q}.
[p] Da’at: Hebrew, “knowledge.” In Mormon Kabbalah, Da’at is the top most Sefirot on the left line of the Kabbalistic tree of life, the Pillar of Severity. In traditional Kabbalah, this spot is the left eye, in Mormon Kabbalah it represents the Divine Masculine, or Heavenly Father.
[q] East represents the knowledge of the Divine Masculine, Heavenly Father, the Awmen. 

14. And I saw that these four beasts were of six wings{r}, and were full of eyes{s}, and they were in constant motion{t} day and night.
[r] Six wings: or “six hundred wings.” Wings here signifies the beasts’ connection to the Creator and the creation.
[s] Full of eyes: signifies their access to divine vision. 
[t] Constant motion day and night: In Kabbalah “day” and “night” signifies our spiritual ups and down as we grow in grace. “Constant motion” signifies that these “beasts” never cease their work for God.

15. And as they were in motion about the thrones, they, each of them as one, said: Holy, holy, holy, Elohim Shaddai{u}, the very Father and Mother.
[u] Elohim Shaddai: “God(s) Almighty,” or the Almighty God(s).”

16. Holy is She who dwelleth in the place which is no place, beyond the infinite height and depth, the infinite of all directions embraced by the Tree of Life;

17. And YHVH the fruit of Her tree, the Yachad Yachid Echad{v} who was, and is, and is to come.
[v] Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh: The Creator, or “I AM that I AM,” or “I AM (the One) that Makes/Creates.”

18. And the beasts did give glory and honor in thanks, and the four and twenty elders did fall down before Him who liveth forever and ever.

19. ¶ And I beheld that not all did worship, but there was one like unto a great serpent, even a leviathan{w}, and he did cause that a third of the host of heaven should follow after him.
[w] Leviathan: Hebrew “livyathan,” masculine noun, “serpent,” a sea monster. May represent Egypt or worldliness (Job 3:8), or could be a crocodile or dragon, etc. According to the Book of Enoch, there is a female leviathan and a male Behemoth (Enoch 10:22-23/60:7-8). At the end of the world the Leviathan will slain (Isaiah 27:1).

20. And I saw as it were a great war in heaven, and Michael and his angels did fight against the leviathan; 

21. And the leviathan fought and so too his angels, and they prevailed not; neither was their place found anymore in heaven.

22. And the great leviathan was cast out, that accuser{x}, he that deceiveth the whole earth; and his envoys were cast out with him.
[x] Satan: “Adversary,” or “Accuser.” 

23. And the leviathan was wroth with Shekinah{c}, therefore he did go down to make war with the remnant of her seed, they which keep the Torah and remember the name YHVH;
[c] Shekinah: “The Presence,” or “the dwelling place of God.” A term used to describe the Divine Feminine or the Spirit of Heavenly Mother. Through the Divine Feminine God receives from us, our prayers and supplication. Also known as the Hai. See Book of Remembrance 2:11.

24. And all that dwell in darkness upon the earth shall worship the leviathan, and their names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world.

25. ¶ And it came to pass that I saw as it were in the midst of the thrones, and elders, and the four beasts, there stood one like unto the Son of Man as a Lamb, waiting to be sent forth to be slain;

26. And from Him came the seven angels of the seven dispensations, being sent forth into all the earth by the Son of Man, whose blood{y} should be spilt upon the rock, for terrible are the works of mankind.
[y] See Mosiah 1:100-101 RAV, 3:7 OPV; Luke 22:42-44; Avahr 35:21-24 (DaC 18:2h-2j CoC, 19:16-19 CJCLdS). 

27. ¶ 

28. And it came to pass that I heard a voice like unto a shofar call from out of the temple of heaven, saying to the seven angels of the seven dispensations: Go thy ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of YHVH upon the earth.

chapter-aka: First Dispensation
chapter-sum: Zenos sees the spiritual vision of the first dispensation, that of Adam and Eve overseen by Michael the archangel who is Adam.

1. And there came Michael{a}, one of the seven angels of the seven dispensations, with a vile;
[a] Michael: Hebrew, “one who is like God.” According to Doctrines of the Saints Appendix 1:11, Adam and Michael the archangel are the same person. According to Book of Remembrance 28:24-31 he is or represent the Holy Spirit. 

2. And he spoke unto me, saying: Come I will show unto thee the judgment of she who prostituteth herself upon the many waters, with whom the nations of the earth have committed fornication{b}; 
[b] Fornication: In Hebrew “adultery” is a masculine noun, usually referring to a man having sex or a sexual relationship with a married woman; also used to describe the worship of idols as God views our relationship/covenant with Him as a marriage covenant. Fornication here refers to Lilith tempting us to break our covenants with God.

3. Yea, and the whole earth hath she made drunk with the wine of her fornication. 

4. And it came to pass that I was carried away in spirit into the wilderness, and there I saw as it were a woman who sat upon a red{c} serpent, yea even that leviathan{d};
[c] Red: In Kabbalah red signifies fire, strength, and judgement. 
[d] Leviathan: Hebrew “livyathan,” masculine noun, “serpent,” a sea monster. May represent Egypt or worldliness (Job 3:8), or could be a crocodile or dragon, etc. According to the Book of Enoch, there is a female leviathan and a male Behemoth (Enoch 10:22-23/60:7-8).

5. And written upon the leviathan were the names of blasphemy unto Elohim Khayyim{e};
[e] Elohim Khayyim: Hebrew, “Living Gods.”

6. And the leviathan had, as it were, seven heads and ten horns, and this to mock the seven and ten flames. 

7. And though she was naked, the woman appeared to be adorned in scarlet {f}, red{c}, and purple{g}, and wearing gold, and precious stones, and pearls;

[f] Scarlet: Hebrew masculine noun. See Isaiah 1:18. 
[g] Purple: Hebrew masculine noun. Represents wealth and luxury of Tyre, see Ezekiel 27:7, 16.

8. And in her right hand she held as it were a golden chalice{h} which was full of abominations and her fornication, and in her hair and her fingers were filthiness{i};
[h] Gold chalice: Hebrew feminine noun. Exodus 25:29 requires a golden cup or bowl for offering libations to the Lord. This cup appears to be a mockery of this.See Doctrines of the Saints 93b:23.
[i] See Psalms 24:3-5, Numbers 8:21, Isaiah 1:15-16, 2 Nephi 25:16 OPV,Alma 5:19 OPV, Doctrines of the Saints 53c:10. 

9. And her name is Lilith{j}, and she is the mother of idolaters, and she and Cain walk the earth teaching mankind the abominations written upon that leviathan.
[j] Lilith: See Book of Remembrance 5:39

10. And it came to pass that I saw as it were the woman lying with Cain, intoxicated by their sins, drunk as it were with the blood of kaddish{k}, and in the blood of all those that have been slain. 
[k] Kaddish: Hebrew “holy.” Here referring to those holy men and women, or saints, of Israel. 

11. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{l} spoke unto me, saying: I shall tell thee the mystery of Lilith, and of the leviathan and his seven heads and his ten horns; 
[l] Angel of YHVH: a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH. 

12. And the serpent that thou sawest shall ascend out of the abyss, being perdition. 

13. And here is wisdom: The seven heads are seven lying tongues on which the woman sitteth that shall oppose the seven angels of the seven dispensations, each one in their turn;

14. And they are seven rulers of man: five are fallen, and two are yet to come;

15. And the ten horns are ten rulers with no power, but they receive power as kings upon the earth for one hour as they join with the leviathan;

16. And these being perdition are as one mind, giving their strength and their power unto Lilith and her leviathan,

17. For these have made war with Yah{m}, and YHVH{n} shall overcome them, for he is Mashiach HaMashiach{o}, Yachad Yachid Echad{p}, the Great High Priest after the order of Melchizedek.
[m] YH: Yod Hei, God the Father and Mother.

19. And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the leviathan, these shall hate Lilith, and shall make her desolate, stripping her naked, and burning her with fire,

20. And this because YHVH shall put in their hearts to fulfil His will, even unto their own detriment should they not return in teshuvah{q}, for the Word of YHVH shall be fulfilled.
[q] Teshuvah: (תשובה) “return.” Here rendered “Grace” and Christ is the way back to God, usually translated as “repentance,” “redemption,” or “grace.”

21. And it came to pass that I saw as it were Shekinah{r}; and she was clothed in a fire as bright as the sun, and she did wear upon her head a crown of twelve stars;
[r] Shekinah: God the Mother, or “divine woman.” See Book of Remembrance 2:11.

22. And I beheld that she was in pain, carrying her child, and the child was ready to be delivered.

23. And it came to pass that when the leviathan saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted Shekinah as she sought to bring forth the man child.

24. And it came to pass that Lilith and Cain and all those that followed after them worshipped the leviathan, saying: Who is like unto the leviathan? 

25. And: Who is able to make war with him?

26. And: He doeth great wonders, even showering the earth with fire from the heavens, 

27. And so did these deceive the men of the earth by his priestcrafts{s} called miracles,

[t] See Zenos 2:10.
[u] Come and see: Hebrew, “nabat,” meaning “Look!”

31. And I saw as it were a man sitting upon a white horse, and unto him was given a crown, and I beheld that he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

32. And it came to pass that I saw Michael sounding his shofar, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, 

33. And the abaddon{v} were cast lose upon the earth, and they burnt up the third part of the trees and all the green grass.
[v] Abaddon: Hebrew feminine noun, “destruction” or “ruin.” See Proverbs 27:20.

34. And it came to pass that YHVH Elohim{w} called Adam and Eve and their sons and daughters to say unto all they that worshiped the leviathan: YHVH knows thy works, and thy labors, and He shall not long be patient; 
[w] YHVH Elohim: YHVH is also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. Elohim translates to “gods” and is both male and female: “El,” Hebrew for “god” is masculine, while “Eloh” is Hebrew for goddess, and “im” is masculine. Thus “Elohim may be male and female as a word with a feminine singular and a masculine plural. YHVH Elohim is typically translated as “the LORD God,” and may denote that YHVH is a part of the Elohim collective “One God.”

35. For how many days more dost thou think YHVH will bear them which are evil? 

36. And thou hast listened to them which say they are holy men and women, and are not, and YHVH hast found them liars.

37. And YHVH has seen they that have left their first love; and He has known them but has crossed out their name. 

38. And to these YHVH says: Remember, O remember, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do again thy first works;

39. And if thou will not, I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy fire out of its place, except thou walk again in teshuvah{q}. 
[q] Teshuvah: (תשובה) “return.” Here rendered “Grace” and Christ is the way back to God, usually translated as “repentance,” “redemption,” or “grace.”

40. And unto they that overcometh shall I give them to eat of the tree of life, which ye left behind in the Eden of Elohim.

41. And it came to pass that Michael went forth, and poured out his vial upon the earth; 

42. And there fell a noise as a loud crying, and they which had the mark of the leviathan upon them, and which worshipped his image, were cursed with a sore curse.

chapter-aka: Second Dispensation
chapter-sum: Zenos sees the spiritual vision of the second dispensation, that of Enoch and his wives overseen by Zaphkiel or Metatron, the archangel who is Enoch.

1. And it came to pass that I beheld Zaphkiel{a} open the second seal, and I heard the beast like unto an ox{b} say: Come and see{c}!
[a] Zaphkiel: Hebrew, “God’s knowledge.” Also known as Jophiel/Yophiel or Zophiel. One of the seven archangels. According to verse 4 of this chapter he is also Metatron, who is Enoch.
[b] See 2 Moses 2:11.
[c] Come and see: Hebrew, “nabat,” meaning “Look!”

2. And it came to pass that I saw as it were another horse going out that was red{d}, and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth;
[d] Red: In Kabbalah red signifies fire, strength, and judgement.

3. And that mankind should war and should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great sword.

4. And it came to pass that Zaphkiel who is Metatron{e} sounded his shofar, and I saw as it were a great mountain burn with fire, and it was cast into the sea,
[e] Metatron: Hebrew: “one who guards.” Also known as Mitatrun (Arabic). One of the seven archangels, known as Zaphiel. Metatron is the angel of the veil. According to Kabbalah, Enoch is given a new name when he is transfigured, and that is Metatron.

5. And the third part of the sea became blood; and death became the third part of the creatures which were in the sea; yea, and a third part of the ships were destroyed.

6. And it came to pass that I saw as it were the leviathan{f}, being red in color, the same as before, with his seven heads and ten horns, and I beheld that he now had seven crowns upon his heads. 
[f] Leviathan: Hebrew “livyathan,” masculine noun, “serpent,” a sea monster. May represent Egypt or worldliness (Job 3:8), or could be a crocodile or dragon, etc. According to the Book of Enoch, there is a female leviathan and a male Behemoth (Enoch 10:22-23/60:7-8). At the end of the world the Leviathan will slain (Isaiah 27:1).

7. And I saw, as it were, his tail had drawn up the third of the stars of heaven, and these were cast down upon the earth, and these had spawned the iyrin{g}.
[g] Iyrin: Hebrew, “awake,” or “watchful.” In the Book of Enoch Iyrin is typically translated as “Watchers) “see Enoch Book of the Watchers). Iyrin are also mentioned in the Book of Daniel (see Daniel 4:13, 13, 27).

8. And it came to pass that I saw as it were the leviathan standing before Shekinah{h}; and she was with child, ready to be delivered; 
[h] Shekinah: God the Mother, or “divine woman.” See Book of Remembrance 2:11.

9. And the leviathan stood ready with his teeth bared, as to devour her child as it should leave the womb;

10. But to my astonishment, I saw as it were two wings{i} were given to Shekinah, like that of an eagle{j}, and she did fly into the wilderness, 
[i] Wings: signifies the Her connection tying the Creator to the creation.
[j] Eagle here represent the element of air, and Gd the Father. This is a reference to the Mother’s equality with the Father and her role in connecting the Heavens and the Earth. 

11. And I saw as it were that she hid there in safety and was nourished far from the face of that serpent Lilith. 

12. And it came to pass that there was power given to the leviathan to speak blasphemies even unto the whole earth, save it be the city in the wilderness where Shekinah did dwell;

13. But unto the rest of the world, death was given them that would not worship the image of the leviathan;

14. And these made war with one another but lived in fear of the city in the wilderness wherein Shekinah dwelt.

15. And it came to pass that Metatron poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man, and everything that did live in the sea died.

16. And I saw great works of darkness, and tribulation, and poverty—even unto those that were rich of the things of the world.

17. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{k} said unto me: Fear not any of those things which thou shalt suffer; 
[k] Angel of YHVH: a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH. 

18. For YHVH{l} has given thee life, and unto all that overcometh the world, these shall not see the second death.

chapter-aka: Zion
chapter-sum: Zion and Shekinah flee the Earth.

1. And it came to pass that I saw as it were Eden{a}, who is Shekinah{b}, who is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which is to say wisdom{c}, and the Tree of Life{d};
[a] Eden: Hebrew feminine noun, proper name meaning “delight.” The term refers to sexual pleasure, and therefore adds to the idea of a marriage covenant between God and mankind. Based on this verse it appears to be a name for the Earth and/or the Divine Feminine/Heavenly Mother. 
[b] Shekinah: God the Mother, or “divine woman.” See Book of Remembrance 2:11.
[c] Chokhmah: Hebrew, “wisdom.” Chokhmah is the top most Sefirot on the right line in the Kabbalistic tree of life, the Pillar of Mercy. In traditional Kabbalah it represents the right eye, in Mormon Kabbalah it represents the Divine Feminine or Heavenly Mother.
[d] Tree of life: See 1 Moses 4:16; Melchizedek 2:10; 1 Nephi 3:46-53 RAV, 11:8-13 OPV; Zenos 2:16, 3:40, 9:5-14. 

2. And the seven malak{e} who are cherubim{f} the seven angels of the seven dispensations went down from the heavens into the earth to do the will of YHVH{g} in the whole earth.
[e] Malak: Arabic and Hebrew for “messenger,” or angel.”
[f] Cherubim: Hebrew form Akkadian meaning “one who blesses;” a type of angel.
[g] YHVH: also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. See Doctrines of the Saints 45e.

3. And it came to pass that when Adam and Eve in their generation were sitting outside the gate of the Garden to behold the radiant appearance of the Shekinah, the whole earth was radiant from one end to the other with her splendor, 

4. And her splendor was greater even than that of the sun at midday, and it blinded the leviathan, and Lilith as she rode upon him;

5. And as these traveled, they brought darkness, and the worship of the sun, the moon, and the stars; 

6. And the worship of the earth, and the worship of the works of the hands of men, which are to worship the leviathan{h}. 
[h] Leviathan: Hebrew “livyathan,” masculine noun, “serpent,” a sea monster. May represent Egypt or worldliness (Job 3:8), or could be a crocodile or dragon, etc. According to the Book of Enoch, there is a female leviathan and a male Behemoth (Enoch 10:22-23/60:7-8). At the end of the world the Leviathan will slain (Isaiah 27:1).

7. And it came to pass that I saw as it were the seven angels of the seven dispensations come before the throne of Elohim{i}, saying: Elohim Shaddai{j}, what shall we do with the children of Adam{k}? 
[i] Elohim: “Gods.” Can denote the Godhead or Trinity as a whole, God the Father & Mother, or the Masculine and Feminine aspects of God.
[j] Elohim Shaddai: “God(s) Almighty,” or the Almighty God(s).”
[k] Adam: Hebrew: “mankind.”

8. For we see that these art gone to worship idols in fornication with Lilith and her leviathan, even that great beast of blasphemy against thy name;

9. And what shall we do to cleanse the earth of this abomination, and to lay waste unto the inhabitants of the earth who worship idols?

10. And it came to pass that YHVH Elohim{l} lifted up His Shekinah from the earth, from the midst of the idol worship, and there Her name was Zion{m}.
[l] YHVH Elohim: YHVH is also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. Elohim translates to “gods” and is both male and female: “El,” Hebrew for “god” is masculine, while “Eloh” is Hebrew for goddess, and “im” is masculine. Thus “Elohim may be male and female as a word with a feminine singular and a masculine plural. YHVH Elohim is typically translated as “the LORD God,” and may denote that YHVH is a part of the Elohim collective “One God.”
[m] Zion: Hebrew, “Tsiyyon” or “Tzion,” meaning “marking.” In Jewish law, if something is found with identifiable makings, that object must be returned to the owner. This would indicate that we, as the Church, belong to God by our marking as Zion, from the Mother through the Son. In Arabic, Zion means “defend.” 

11. And I saw as it were the seven angels of the seven dispensations with armies and the hosts of heaven camped as it were roundabout the earth in camps of thousands and tens of thousands hosts;

12. And I saw as it were that these fetched their shofars and took the horns in their hands and surrounded the Shekinah of YHVH{n} with songs.
[n] Shekinah of YHVH: this could refer to the Mother of God (the Divine Feminine) or the bide of Christ as Shekinah can refer to the Divine Feminine and the Church/congregation. See Zenos 12:47.

13. And it came to pass that Zion ascended to the high heavens, as it is written, and Enoch was lifted up to heaven together with Shekinah. 

14. And the angel of YHVH{o} came unto me saying: When the Lamb desired to be lifted up upon that tree for the sins of mankind, He first sent Michael the Prince to prepare the earth for YHVH;
[o] Angel of YHVH: a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH.

15. And then he sent Zaphkiel who is Metatron to gather all they that would follow YHVH and to carry them in Shekinah and in great glory in a fiery chariot with horses of flame and fire, driven by malak{p} of glory. 
[p] Malak: Arabic and Hebrew for “messenger,” or angel.” 

16. And it came to pass that I saw as it were YHVH lifting Enoch up to the high heavens together with Shekinah; 

17. And it came to pass that I saw as it were that when these reached the high heavens, the sapphires whereupon was written the Torah{q} were aflame as though to be burned up in a consuming fire, 
[q] Torah: Hebrew meaning Instructions, Teachings, or Law.

18. And I puzzled in amazement, wondering what flames could devour the Torah in fire?

19. And it came to pass that there came a voice as thunder from the Throne in Heaven saying: Fear not; for because all the children of man have denied me and my kingdom, and have gone a whoring after Lilith, worshipping idols, I have removed my Shekinah from among them and have lifted Her up on high;

20. But these whom I have taken from among them are mine elect, even the inhabitants of the Zion come out of the world, for these are equal to one with another in faith, in righteousness, and in perfection.

21. And thus, I have taken these from the earth which is my creation under all the heavens unto my bosom, and these shall I return in the last days;

22. For these from the generation{r} have I preserved from the Flood, lifting them upon the wings of the wind{s}, taking my Shekinah to the highest heaven that she may sit with me again upon my throne;
[r] Generation: or “dispensation.”
[s] Wind: the element of air represents the Divine Masculine, God the Father. 

23. And unto She is given the key to the gates of understanding, and subtlety, and life, and grace, and kindness, and love, and meekness, and preservation, and mercy, and honor;

24. And these are given Her that mankind may learn to worship YHVH in wisdom and knowledge unto understanding; 

25. And in understanding unto mercy and instruction; and in mercy and instruction unto beauty, love, and kindness, and unto victory in my kingdom; 

26. And this is the foundation , and this is to walk in teshuvah unto splendor; 

27. And I have adorned mankind with all these good and praiseworthy things; and unto Israel more than all the children of heaven.

chapter-aka: Third Dispensation
chapter-sum: Zenos sees the spiritual vision of the third dispensation, that of Noah and Na’amah overseen by Gabriel the archangel who is Noah.

1. And it came to pass that I saw that Gabriel{a} followed Michael and Metatron, saying: All those who shall worship the leviathan{b}, receiving his mark on their forehead, or in their hand, these shall feel the wrath of YHVH{c} poured out unto thee from the cup of his indignation; 
[a] Gabriel: Hebrew, “Man of God.”
[b] Leviathan: Hebrew “livyathan,” masculine noun, “serpent,” a sea monster. May represent Egypt or worldliness (Job 3:8), or could be a crocodile or dragon, etc. According to the Book of Enoch, there is a female leviathan and a male Behemoth (Enoch 10:22-23/60:7-8). At the end of the world the Leviathan will slain (Isaiah 27:1).
[c] YHVH: also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. See Doctrines of the Saints 45e.

2. These things saith He which holdeth in his hands that sharpened two-edged sword;

3. For He knows thy works, and where thou dwellest; therefore, hold thee fast the name YHVH, and speak not His holy name in vain!

4. Eat not anything sacrificed unto idols, for this is to commit adultery{d} and fornication, but walk thee in teshuvah{e}; 
[d] Adultery: Hebrew masculine noun, usually refers to a man having sex or a sexual relationship with a married woman; also used to describe the worship of idols as God views our relationship/covenant with Him as a marriage covenant.
[e] Teshuvah: (תשובה) “return.” Usually translated as “repentance,” “redemption,” or “grace.”

5. Or I shall come at thee quickly, and when ye least expect, and will fight against thee with the sword of my mouth;

6. But to they that overcome shall be given to eat of the hidden manna, and the fruit of the tree of life,

7. And unto these shall be given a new name written upon a white stone, and no one shall look upon the stone and see in it except they that do receive it;

8. For the new name given unto the kaddish{f} of YHVH is thy call to service to YHVH in His Holy Priesthood, and the white stone is thy urim and thummim{g}.
[f] Kaddish: Hebrew “holy.” Here referring to those holy men and women, or saints, of Israel.
[g] Urim and Thummim: Hebrew “Lights and Perfections." A holy or sacred device for divining oracles. This may refer to a seer stone, something similar to what Joseph Smith Jr. used or the bow with stones as the Nephites had and Joseph Smith Jr. used to translate the lost 116 pages of the Book of Mormon, or something else entirely. See Exodus 28:30; Leviticus 8:8; Numbers 27:21; Deuteronomy 33:8; Ezra 2:63; Mosiah 5:72-75, 8:13 OPV; Ether 1:88-93 RAV, 3:23- 28 OPV; Avahr 7:34, 24:28, 39:2).


9. And it came to pass that I saw that Gabriel opened the third seal, and I heard the beast{h} with the face of a man say: Come and see{i}!
[h] Beast with the face of man: see Zenos 2:12.
[i] Come and see: Hebrew, “nabat,” meaning “Look!”

10. And I saw as it were a black horse, and his rider bore judgment in his right hand, and a sword in his left.

11. And it came to pass that Gabriel sounded his shofar, and there fell a great fire from heaven, and it fell upon the third part of the waters on the earth, and a third part of the waters beneath the earth;

12. And the waters came forth as a great flood, and many died because of the waters, that there should be a new birth from the cleansing.

13. And it came to pass that Gabriel poured his vial out upon the waters; and they became as blood.

14. And it came to pass that I heard Gabriel say: Thou art righteous, YHVH, which art, and was, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus;

15. For these have made war against thy people, YHVH, and shed the blood of thy servants the prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. 

16. And it came to pass that I saw, as it were, Shekinah{j} in the wilderness, in the place prepared for her of YHVH, and there I saw that His Shekinah was fed for sixty{k} years{l}.
[j] Shekinah: God the Mother, or “divine woman.” See Book of Remembrance 2:11.
[k] Samekh: The fifteenth letter of the Hebrew aleph-bet. This letter can mean “support” or “trust,” referring specifically to divine protection.
[l] Years: Hebrew, “shannah,” feminine noun meaning “annually;” from the root “shana,” meaning “given to change, or “disguised.” 

17. And it came to pass that the leviathan spat water out of his mouth as a it were a flood after Shekinah, that he might cause her to be carried away of the waters.

18. And the earth did help Shekinah, for the earth did open her mouth swallowing up the flood which the leviathan did cast out of his mouth that the waters could not reach up unto Her.

19. And the leviathan opened his mouth to blasphemy against YHVH Elohim{m}, to blaspheme His name, and His tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
[m] YHVH Elohim: YHVH is also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. Elohim translates to “gods” and is both male and female: “El,” Hebrew for “god” is masculine, while “Eloh” is Hebrew for goddess, and “im” is masculine. Thus “Elohim may be male and female as a word with a feminine singular and a masculine plural. YHVH Elohim is typically translated as “the LORD God,” and may denote that YHVH is a part of the Elohim collective “One God.”

20. And it came to pass that after the waters had subsided he caused all mankind to receive a mark upon their right hand, or in their foreheads as an oath and covenant that none might buy or sell, save they had the mark, or the name of the leviathan, or the number of his name.

21. And this mark was like unto that with which Cain had been marked by YHVH, to make a mockery of the things of Elohim.

22. And the mark of the leviathan is Vav Samekh Mem (666, וסם), and the name of the leviathan is Samael{n} who is Samyaza{o}.
[n] Samael: Hebrew (לֵמאַָּס), “venom of God,” or “poison of God.” An accuser (Satan), seducer, and destroyer. He is seen as the angel of death in Judaism, and as Satan in Christianity. 
[o] Who is Samyaza: Hebrew, “I have seen.” See Enoch 12:42 (69:2), Added to the original text by inspiration from Anni Rose, Matriarch.

chapter-aka: Fourth Dispensation
chapter-sum: Zenos sees the spiritual vision of the fourth dispensation, that of Melchizedek and his wife (wives?) overseen by Raphael the archangel who is Melchizedek.

1. And it came to pass that I saw as it were the Son of Man{a} standing upon a great mountain{b}, and the strength of Zion{c} with Him;
[a] Son of Man: Literally “son of enash” in Hebrew. This is different from the usual Hebrew, “ben-’Adam” or “son of mankind,” “human.” This term is also used in Daniel 7:13-14 which appears to be speaking of Jesus Christ. 
[b] Great mountain: this could also be translated as “mighty temple.”
[c] Zion: Hebrew, “Tsiyyon” or “Tzion,” meaning “marking.” In Jewish law, if something is found with identifiable makings, that object must be returned to the owner. This would indicate that we, as the Church, belong to God by our marking as Zion, from the Mother through the Son. In Arabic, Zion means “defend.” 

2. And with Him I saw as it were one hundred forty and four thousand kaddish{d}, these having the Holy Name of Elohim{e} written{f} in their foreheads.
[d] Kaddish: Hebrew “holy.” Here referring to those holy men and women, or saints, of Israel. 
[e] Elohim: “Gods.” Can denote the Godhead or Trinity as a whole, God the Father & Mother, or the Masculine and Feminine aspects of God.
[f] Written on their foreheads: Refers to those that have made their temple covenants, being anointed, so they are Zion, as they have been marked as servants of God.

3. And it came to pass that I heard the angel of YHVH{g} saying: Here are they that keep the commandments of Elohim, in their faith in YHVH.
[g] Angel of YHVH: a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH.

4. And it came to pass that I saw as it were Lilith{h} about the earth calling herself a prophetess, teaching and seducing kaddish{d} to commit fornication{i}, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols;
[d] Kaddish: Hebrew “holy.” Here referring to those holy men and women, or saints, of Israel. 
[h] Lilith: See Book of Remembrance 4-5
[i] Fornication: In Hebrew “adultery” is a masculine noun, usually referring to a man having sex or a sexual relationship with a married woman; also used to describe the worship of idols as God views our relationship/covenant with Him as a marriage covenant. Fornication here refers to Lilith tempting us to break our covenants with God.

5. And though YHVH{j} had given her space to repent of her fornication, she repented not;
[j] YHVH: also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. See Doctrines of the Saints 45e.

6. And I saw that great distress{k} awaited those that went with her into her bed to commit adultery with her, except they return{l} from their deeds.
[k] Distress: Hebrew, “tsarah,” feminine noun, “vexer,” or “rival wife.”
[l] Teshuvah: (תשובה) “return.” Usually translated as “repentance,” “redemption,” or “grace.”

7. Yea, and YHVH did slay{m} her children with death when she left the garden, refusing to return; for YHVH gives unto all, yea everyone, according to their works;
[m] See Book of Remembrance 5:35-36.

8. But unto they that overcometh, and are keeping the Word and the works of YHVH unto the end, to these will He give power and dominion;

9. For these YHVH shall rule with the rod of iron{n}; and he shall be their potter, and they His chosen vessels that He shall mold and form; for these He shall receive from Elohim;
[n] See 1 Nephi 3:68 RAV, 11:25 OPV.

10. And these that shall be given Him shall be as His morning stars{o}.
[o] Morning Stars: Hebrew, “boqer kochvei.” Morning star (helel, “shining one”) is a title for Lucifer before he fell (Isaiah 14:12), and for Jesus Christ (Revelation 22:16, 2Peter 1:19). This reference matches Job 38:7. This is likely a reference to the Saints becoming join heirs with Jesus Christ (Romans 8:17). 

11. And it came to pass that Raphael{p} opened the fourth seal, and I heard the voice of the beast as an eagle{q} in the air saying: Come and see{r}!
[p] Raphael: Hebrew, “God has healed.” Raphael is mentioned by name in the Book of Enoch, Tobit, and it is believed that he is the angel mentioned in John 5:2-4. He is Melchizedek (Doctrines of the Saints 17d:30 & 108b:11).
[q] See Zenos 2:13.
[r] Come and see: Hebrew, “nabat,” meaning “Look!” 

12. And I saw as it were a pale horse whose rider is Death; and sheol{s} came after them; 
[s] Sheol: Hebrew feminine noun, “grave” or “sepulcher.” Originally the grave but became to be known as the afterlife. While some today see this term to mean “hell,” it would not have had this meaning when this revelation was received.

13. And power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

14. And it came to pass that Raphael blew upon his shofar, and the third part of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars were smitten; 

15. Yea, and as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise, and the earth was covered in darkness for it would receive not the light.

16. And it came to pass that I saw the angel Moroni{t} flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice: Woe unto the inhabitants of the earth for there are three more angels yet to sound!
[t] Moroni: Arabic, “at the place of fire.” See Revelation 14:6-7, Doctrines of the Saints 13a:10-17.

17. And it came to pass that Raphael poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with the judgment{u} of fire.
[u] Din: (דין) Hebrew, “judgement.” Here representing Gevurah: Hebrew: (גבורה), “strength,” the essence of judgment and limitation, corresponding to the element of fire.

18. And mankind was scorched with a great heat, and cursed the name of Elohim, and they repented not, nor did they come to give Them glory.

19. And it came to pass that I saw as it were Shekinah{v} where she was sent away into the wilderness, 
[v] Shekinah: God the Mother, or “divine woman.” See Book of Remembrance 2:11.

20. And I beheld that she brought forth a man child; and he is to rule all nations with a rod of iron{n} and his name is King of Peace{w};
[n] See 1 Nephi 3:68 RAV, 11:25 OPV.
[w] Melchizedek: “King of Peace,” see Book of Melchizedek, see 1 Moses 25:24.

21. And by this King of Peace was Shekinah able to travel again from the earth to the heavens.

22. And it came to pass that her child was caught up unto Elohim, even as Enoch, and to the thrones I had seen afore.

23. And it came to pass that power was given unto the leviathan{x} and Lilith and Cain to make war with the sons and daughters of YHVH{y}, and to overcome them;

8. And there came out of the smoke ten plagues{f} upon the earth, and unto them was given power to harm the men that would keep Israel from her Elohim.
[f] Ten plagues: See Exodus 7:14-12:36.

9. And they were commanded that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree;

[e] Angel of YHVH: a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH.
[f] Come and see: Hebrew, “nabat,” meaning “Look!”

5. And I saw as it were a tree of exceeding beauty, and the tree and its fruit was of an exceeding purity; 

6. And about the path that did lead to the tree I saw as it were a great mist, and a river of filthy water, and on the other side of that water a great temple dedicated to the leviathan.

7. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH said unto me: Come and see!

[j] Tevilah: Hebrew. a ritual bath where one is fully immersed in water, similar to the Christian baptism. 

16. And after that he was washed clean, the Heavens did open, and Ruach Ha’Kodesh{k} did fall upon Him from the heavens descending.

22. And it came to pass that I saw as it were the temple of the leviathan, which is the pride of the world; and it fell in its haughtiness, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. 

23. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH spoke unto me, saying: Behold the fountain of filthy water, and the depths thereof, these are the abyss of sheol{o}; 
[o] Sheol: Hebrew feminine noun, “grave” or “sepulcher.” Originally the grave but became to be known as the afterlife. While some today see this term to mean “hell,” it would not have had this meaning when this revelation was received. 

24. And the mists of darkness are the temptations of Lilith{p}, which blindeth the eyes, and harden the hearts of the children of men, leading them away that they become lost that they might perish; 
[p] Lilith: See Book of Remembrance 4-5

32. And it came to pass that he did leadeth mankind into captivity, yea and all did go into captivity;

33. And vengeance was his name, saying: He that killeth by the sword must be killed by the sword!

34. But Israel is to learn patience and faith, for many did I see that were wounded by the sword and did live, and this because of the Mashiach HaMashiach to come.

35. And it came to pass that I saw as it were they which walk in teshuvah{q}, the kaddish no longer defiled with women, or in other words, transgressing the Torah{r} of YHVH; for these are virgins{s}.

38. And seeing this, the mercy of YHVH, I cried out saying: Thou hast turned away thy judgments, because of thy Son!

39. And the Lamb spoke unto me saying: Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it;

40. For though thou hast little strength, thou hast kept my Word, and hast not denied my name;

42. And it shall come to pass that when Zadkiel{t} shall opened the sixth seal there shall be a great earthquake; and the sun shall become black as the depths of a great well {u}, and the moon become as blood{u}; 
[t] Zadkiel: Hebrew, “Tzadiqiel,” “Righteousness of God” or Grace of God.” Rabbinical tradition considers him to be the angel of mercy. Some Rabbinical traditions hold that Zadkiel is the angel of YHVH. 
[u] See Joel 2:30-31; 1 Nephi 5:242 RAV, 19:10 OPV.

43. And the stars of heaven shall fall{v} unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind.

48. And I saw that there should be sealed one hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.

49. Of the tribe of Judah should be sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben should be sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad should be sealed twelve thousand,

50. Of the tribe of Asher should be sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Naphtali should be sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh (who is also Dan){z} should be sealed twelve thousand.

[aa] Euphrates: Hebrew, “Perth.”

54. And it shall come to pass that the four angels shall be loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men;

55. And the number of the army of the horsemen were too numerous than I could count, nor could I number them.

56. And it shall come to pass that by these will the third part of mankind be killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which shall be issued out of their mouths;

57. And their power is in their mouth, and upon their tongues, and in their tails; for their tails were like unto serpents whipping about, and their heads with sharp teeth, and with these they do hurt.

58. And it came to pass that the rest of mankind which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk;

59. Neither repented they of their murders{bb}, nor of their priestcrafts{cc}, nor of their fornication{dd}, nor of their thefts{ee}.

64. For these shall be they who shall hand the Lamb of YHVH to be sacrificed upon the tree, and knowing not what they do, these shall scourge him and mock him for the sake of the leviathan.

65. But they shall not kill Him, for He is YHVH, and He is the master of life and death;

66. And before He shall be taken up, He shall heal the sick, and the blind He shall cause to see, and even the dead shall He raise;

67. But in the time that He shall choose, He will give up the ghost{u} gladly that we might live, and on the third day{u} shall He take back His own life, for the keys of the sepulcher{o} are His.

[o] Sheol: Hebrew feminine noun, “grave” or “sepulcher.” Originally the grave but became to be known as the afterlife. While some today see this term to mean “hell,” it would not have had this meaning when this revelation was received. 

68. And it shall come to pass, and the day shall come that the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and every bondman, and every free man shall hide themselves in the dens{ii} and in the rocks of the mountains; 
[ii] Den: Hebrew “gob,” “den,” or “pit.” 

69. And these shall say unto the mountains and rocks: Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of They that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;

70. Yea, and these shall say: The great day of His wrath is surely come; and who shall be able to stand?

71. And YHVH Elohim{jj} shall surely visit all the House of Israel at that day; 
[jj] YHVH Elohim: YHVH is also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. Elohim translates to “gods” and is both male and female: “El,” Hebrew for “god” is masculine, while “Eloh” is Hebrew for goddess, and “im” is masculine.

74. And all these things must surely come, and the rocks of the earth must rend; 

75. And because of the groanings of the earth, many of the kings of the isles of the sea shall be wrought upon by Ruach Ha’Kodesh, to exclaim: The Elohim of nature suffers.

76. And those at Jerusalem shall be scourged by all people because they crucify YHVH, and turned their hearts aside, rejecting signs, and wonders, and power and glory of YHVH; 

77. And because they turned their hearts aside and have despised Ha’Kadosh Israel{kk}, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all nations; 
[kk] Ha’Kadosh Israel: Hebrew: “The Holy One of Israel.” 

78. Nevertheless, when that day cometh that they no more turn aside their hearts against the Ha’Kadosh Israel, then will He remember the covenants which He made to their fathers; 

79. Yea, then will He remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all the people which are of the House of Israel, will I gather in, saith YHVH, from the four quarters of the earth; 

80. Yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of YHVH; every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, shall be blessed.

1. And it came to pass that I saw the last days, and woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! 

2. For the Leviathan{a} and Lilith{b} and Cain and their avaddon{c} shall come unto you, and these shall come forth with a great wrath, because they knoweth that they hath but a short time left.
[a] Leviathan: Hebrew “livyathan,” masculine noun, “serpent,” a sea monster. May represent Egypt or worldliness (Job 3:8), or could be a crocodile or dragon, etc. According to the Book of Enoch, there is a female leviathan and a male Behemoth (Enoch 10:22-23/60:7-8). At the end of the world the Leviathan will slain (Isaiah 27:1).
[b] Lilith: See Book of Remembrance 4-5
[c] Avaddon: Hebrew, “doom,” or “destruction.” See Job 26:5-7, 31:12, Proverbs 27:20.

3. And it came to pass that I saw as it were a great beast{d} at the last day like unto a leopard ready to pounce, and his feet were as the feet of a bear prepared to maul, and his mouth as that of a lion waiting to devour.
[d] This may be Ephraim rejecting the Lord, acting as an antichrist; see Hosea 13:4-8, Revelation 13:2.

4. And it shall come to pass that the leviathan will give him power and great authority and fame in the world of man, his name being known for both good and evil among mankind.

5. And it shall come to pass that one of his heads shall be wounded as it were unto death; 

6. And his deadly wound shall be healed; and because of this all the world shall wonder after the leviathan and Lilith.

7. And it came to pass that I saw as it were another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as the leviathan.

8. And he shall make use of all the powers of the first beast before him and shall cause the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

9. And here is a great secret: the great beast is the church of avaddon, and though it shall be thought destroyed in reformation, it shall even live;

10. And the second beast shall be as the first, and shall teach that there is no Elohim{e}, and great shall be his evangelists in the sight of mankind.
[e] Elohim: “Gods.” Can denote the Godhead or Trinity as a whole, God the Father & Mother, or the Masculine and Feminine aspects of God. 

11. And the prophets of these beasts shall serve the leviathan, and these shall come into Israel as Pride, Ego, and Sin, lusting after the things of the flesh;

12. For behold, I say unto you that there are save two churches{f} only: Israel{g} and the church of avaddon; and these are not the gatherings of mankind but are in them the men and women that are gathered.
[f] Two churches: See 1 Nephi 220-223 RAV, 14:10 OPV; Moroni 7:3-18 RAV, 7:3-19 OPV.
[g] Israel: See Doctrines of the Saints 2g:20-26.

13. And this is why YHVH{h} hath said unto those who breathe neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot;
[h] YHVH: also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. See Doctrines of the Saints 45e.

14. Therefore unto those that art lukewarm, being neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth{i}.
[i] See Revelation 3:15-17.

15. For these are the rich of this world who say: I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing;

16. Yet these are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, being lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, for they are indifferent, with no love in their hearts for their fellow man.

17. Wherefore, I say unto these: Give thy gold unto the poor that thou mayest be rich and I shall dress thee in white garments, that thou mayest be clothed in righteousness.

18. And it shall come to pass that when Ariel{j} shall open the seventh seal, there will be silence in the heavens for a short time.
[j] Ariel: Hebrew, “Lion of God.” Also known as Uriel. 

19. And it came to pass that I saw as it were the seven angels of the seven dispensations which stood before YHVH Elohim{k}; and to them were given seven shofars.

Elohim translates to “gods” and is both male and female: “El,” Hebrew for “god” is masculine, while “Eloh” is Hebrew for goddess, and “im” is masculine. Thus “Elohim may be male and female as a word with a feminine singular and a masculine plural. YHVH Elohim is typically translated as “the LORD God,” and may denote that YHVH is a part of the Elohim collective “One God.”

20. And it came to pass that another angel came and stood at the altar, and there, with the burning of frankincense, he offered the prayers of all the kaddish{l} upon the golden altar which was before the throne of Elohim.
[l] Kaddish: Hebrew “holy.” Here referring to those holy men and women, or saints, of Israel.

21. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the kaddish, ascended up before YHVH Elohim out of the angel's hand. 

22. And the angel took fire from off the altar and cast it into the earth which did bring thunder, and lightning, and an earthquake.

23. And it came to pass that the seven angels of the seven dispensations placed their shofars to their lips prepared to sound again, for this shall be the final dispensation before the coming of Yahshua HaMashiach{m}.
[m] Yahshua HaMashiach: Hebrew, “Jesus the Messiah,” or “Jesus the Christ.” See 2 Nephi 11:36 RAV, 25:19b OPV. 

24. And it came to pass that I saw the angel Moroni{n} fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel{o} to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 
[n] Moroni: Arabic, “at the place of fire.” See Revelation 14:6-7, Doctrines of the Saints 13a:10-17.
[o] See Revelation 14:6-7, Doctrines of the Saints 13a:8-13.

25. And he did call out with a loud voice, saying: Fear YHVH, and give glory to Him; for the hour of his judgment is come; 

26. Bow down and worship Him that made the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

27. And it came to pass that Uriel followed after him, saying: Sodom is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,

28. And she helped not the poor, nor the widowed, giving not of her bread, but was full of the pride of her abominations.

29. And I saw as it were a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of Man, having a golden crown (keter) upon His head, and a sharp sickle in His right hand. 

30. And it came to pass that Haniel came forth from out of the heavenly temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle, and reap! 

31. And: See that the time has come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

32. And He that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. 

33. And it came to pass that Sandalphon came forth from out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.

34. And it came to pass that Moroni came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and called out with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying: Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.

35. And it came to pass that Sandalphon{p} thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of YHVH.
[p] Sandalphon: Hebrew “godfather.” According to Rabbinic tradition, this may be Elijah after being taken into Heaven. 

36. And it came to pass that I saw as it were that the winepress was trodden, and blood came out of the winepress, and the winepress was full, yea and even runneth over.

37. And it came to pass that I saw Raziel{q} who is Raphael come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud;
[q] Raziel: Hebrew, “secret of God.” Also known as Raphael, who is Melchizedek. 

38. And a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire;

39. And he had in his hand as it were a small book, and he opened the book, and he planted his right foot in the mercy of YHVH, and his left foot in the wisdom of Shekinah{r};
[r] Shekinah: God the Mother, or “divine woman.” See Book of Remembrance 2:11.

40. And Raziel cried out with a loud voice, and the other six of the seven malak{s} who are cherubim{t} over the seven dispensations cried with him.
[s] Malak: Arabic and Hebrew for “messenger,” or angel.”
[t] Cherubim: Hebrew form Akkadian meaning “one who blesses;” a type of angel.

41. And it came to pass that when the seven angels of the seven dispensations had uttered their voices, I heard them with voices as it were lions, saying: 

42. May YHVH brighten our eyes with the light of His Torah{u}, with wisdom{v} and knowledge{w} may He place in our hearts His understanding{x} that all may be worthy to greet Him; for He will enlighten they that hear!
[u] Torah: Hebrew meaning Instructions, Teachings, or Law. Here “Torah” may reference the covenant.
[v] Chokhmah: Hebrew, “wisdom.” Chokhmah is the top most Sefirot on the right line in the Kabbalistic tree of life, the Pillar of Mercy. In traditional Kabbalah it represents the right eye, in Mormon Kabbalah it represents the Divine Feminine or Heavenly Mother.
[w] Da’at: Hebrew, “knowledge.” In Mormon Kabbalah, Da’at is the top most Sefirot on the left line of the Kabbalistic tree of life, the Pillar of Severity. In traditional Kabbalah, this spot is the left eye, in Mormon Kabbalah it represents the Divine Masculine, or Heavenly Father.
[x] Binah: Hebrew, “understanding;” intuitive understanding, or contemplation. In Mormon Kabbalah, the location or mystical state where all ten sefirot in the Tree of Life are united as one. Binah is the hidden sefirot located below Keter in the middle column, between Da’at, Chokhmah, Chesed, and Gevurah. Though Binal we can glimpse the infinity of Keter.

43. Awaken therefore the heart{y} with eternal victory{z}, to make the heart shine with brilliance{aa}.
[y] Tif’eret: Hebrew, “adornment;” this sefirot is associated with spirituality, balance, integration, beauty, miracles, and compassion. In Mormon Kabbalah, Tif’eret sits in the middle column, below Binah and above Yesod. Tid’eret is the “heart” of the Tree of Life as it is the only Sefirot connected to all of the other Sefirot and represents the bosom on the human body. 
[z] Netzach, Hebrew “eternity;” this Sefirot represents eternity, victory, and endurance. Netzach is located at the bottom of the left pillar on the tree of life, representing the right foot. Together, Hod and Netzach represent motion.
[aa] Shine with brilliance: Hebrew, “zohar;” “shining,” “splendor,” “radiance,” or “brightness.” It should be clear that the Kabbalistic text, the Zohar, was written after Zenos was alive.

44. And more did they say that I am forbidden to say, but their words are sealed up.

45. And it came to pass that Areal who is Uriel{bb} sounded his shofar and there were great voices in heaven, saying: The kingdoms of the earth are become the kingdoms of YHVH, and he shall reign forever and ever.
[bb] Uriel: or Oriel; Hebrew, “Light of God,” or God is my light.” Also known as Ariel. 

46. And I saw as it were the twenty-four elders which sat before the throne of Elohim fell upon their faces, 

47. And these worshipped YHVH, saying: We give thee thanks, YHVH Elohim Shaddai, which art, and wast, and art to come, because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.

48. And it came to pass that Uriel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying: It is done.

49. And I heard as it were numerous voices of men and women in heaven, saying: Alleluia! Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto YHVH our Elohim, for true and righteous are His judgments!

50. And he hath judged Lilith, who did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of His servants at her hand! Alleluia!

51. And the twenty-four elders and the four beasts all fell down and worshipped the Elohim that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia!

52. And a voice came out of the throne, saying: Praise our Elohim, all ye Their servants, and ye that fear YHVH, both great and small.

53. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying: Alleluia! And YHVH Elohim omnipotent reigneth;

54. Therefore, let us be rejoicing in the day of our salvation, and give honor to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and Shekinah hath made herself ready.

55. And to Her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, and the fine linen is the righteousness of kaddish.

56. And the angel of YHVH{cc} said: Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb! 
[cc] Angel of YHVH: a heavenly being representing and commissioned to speak on behalf of YHVH.

57. And it came to pass that beholding all this, I fell to the earth saying: Thou art merciful O Elohim, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; 

58. Yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those which were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me; 

59. Yea, O YHVH, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.

60. And again, O Elohim, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my prayer, and when I did turn unto my closet, O YHVH, and prayed unto thee, thou didst hear me; 

61. Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children, when they cry unto thee to be heard of thee, and not of men; and thou wilt hear them; 

62. Yea, O Elohim, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations; 

63. Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out, and have been despised by mine enemies; 

64. Yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger, with speedy destruction; 

65. And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me; 

66. Therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions; for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.

chapter-aka: The parable of the roots and the branches.
chapter-sum: (Compare to Jacob 3:30b-153 RAV, 52-77 OPV)

1. And it came to pass that, the vision having ended, the angel of YHVH came unto me gain saying: Open thy mouth and speak thee the Word of YHVH that thou shalt cry unto this nation.

2. And it came to pass that I, Zenos, opened my mouth and began to prophesy, saying: Hearken O ye House of Israel, and hear the words of me, a prophet of YHVH!

3. For behold, thus saith YHVH, I will liken thee, O House of Israel, like unto a tame olive tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.

4. And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive tree began to decay; and he sayeth: I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish not.

5. And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it, and nourished it, according to his word.

6. And it came to pass that after many days, it began to put forth somewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the main top thereof began to perish.

7. And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it, and he sayeth unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild olive tree, and bring them hither unto me;

8. And we will pluck off those main branches which are beginning to wither away, and we will cast them into the fire, that they may be burned.

9. And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will; 

10. And it mattereth not that if it so be, that the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.

11. Take thou the branches of the wild olive tree, and graft them in, in the stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off, I will cast into the fire, and burn them, that they may not cumber the ground of my vineyard.

12. And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the vineyard, having done according to the word of the Lord of the vineyard, and grafted in the branches of the wild olive tree. 

13. And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; 

14. Wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing; 

15. Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and nourish it, according to my words.

16. And these will I place in the nethermost part of my vineyard, whithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; 

17. And I do it, that I may preserve unto myself the natural branches of the tree; and also, that I may lay up fruit thereof, against the season, unto myself, for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree, and the fruit thereof.

18. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went his way, and hid the natural branches of the tame olive tree in the nethermost parts of the vineyard; some in one, and some in another, according to his will and pleasure.

19. And it came to pass that that after much time had passed, the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto his servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor in the vineyard.

20. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and also the servant, went down into the vineyard to labor.

21. And it came to pass that the servant sayeth unto his master: Behold, look here; behold the tree.

22. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and beheld the tree, in the which the wild olive branches had been grafted; and it had sprang forth, and began to bear fruit.

23. And he beheld that it was good; and the fruit thereof was like unto the natural fruit.

24. And he sayeth unto the servant: Behold, the branches of the wild tree hath taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof, that the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; 

25. And because of the much strength of the root thereof, the wild branches hath brought forth tame fruit.

26. Now if we had not grafted in these branches, the tree thereof would have perished.

27. And now, behold, I shall lay up much fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought forth; and the fruit thereof I shall layup, against the season, unto mine own self.

28. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant: Come, let us go to the nethermost part of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches of the tree hath not brought forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of the fruit thereof, against the season, unto mine own self.

29. And it came to pass that they went forth whither the master of the vineyard had hid the natural branches of the tree, and he sayeth unto the servant: Behold these.

30. And he beheld the first, that it had brought forth much fruit; and he beheld also, that it was good.

31. And he sayeth unto the servant: Take of the fruit thereof, and lay it up, against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self, 

32. For behold, this long time have I nourished it, and it hath brought forth much fruit.

33. And it came to pass that the servant sayeth unto his master: How comest thou hither to plant this tree, or this branch of the tree? For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy vineyard.

34. And the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto him: Counsel me not! I knew that it was a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, I have nourished it this long time; and thou beholdest that it hath brought forth much fruit.

35. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto his servant: Look hither: behold, I have planted another branch of the tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer than the first, 

36. But, behold the tree: I have nourished it this long time, and it hath brought forth much fruit; therefore, gather it, and lay it up, against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self.

37. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth again unto his servant: Look hither, and behold another branch also, which I have planted; behold that I have nourished it also, and it hath brought forth fruit.

38. And he sayeth unto the servant: Look hither, and behold the last; yea, behold: this have I planted in a good spot of ground, and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit; and the other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit: behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.

39. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant: Pluck off the branches that have not brought forth good fruit, and cast them into the fire.

40. But behold, the servant sayeth unto him: Let us prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little longer, that perhaps it may bring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up against the season.

41. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and the servant of the Lord of the vineyard, did nourish all the fruit of the vineyard.

42. And it came to pass that a much time had passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto his servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard; 

43. For behold, the time draweth near, and the end soon cometh, wherefore, I must lay up fruit, against the season, unto mine own self.

44. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and the servant, went down into the vineyard; and they came to the tree whose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches had been grafted in; and behold, all sorts of fruit did cumber the tree.

45. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard did taste of the fruit, every sort according to its number.

46. And the Lord of the vineyard saith: Behold, this long time have we nourished this tree, and I have laid up unto myself against the season, much fruit.

47. But behold, this time it hath brought forth much fruit, and there is none of it which is good.

48. And behold, there are all kinds of bad fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding all our labor: and now, it grieveth me that I should lose this tree.

49. And the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant: What shall we do unto the tree, that I may preserve again good fruit thereof unto mine own self?

50. And the servant sayeth unto his master: Behold, because thou didst graft in the branches of the wild olive tree, they have nourished the roots, that they are alive, and they have not perished; wherefore, thou beholdest that they are yet good.

51. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto his servant: The tree profiteth me nothing, and the roots thereof profiteth me nothing, so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit.

52. Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good; and for mine own purpose I have preserved them; and because of their much strength, they have hitherto brought forth from the wild branches, good fruit.

53. But behold, the wild branches have grown, and have overran the roots thereof; and because that the wild branches have overcome the roots thereof, it hath brought forth much evil fruit;

54. And because that it hath brought forth so much evil fruit, thou beholdest that it begineth to perish; and it will soon become ripened, that it may be cast into the fire, except we should do something for it to preserve it.

55. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto his servant: Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard and see if the natural branches have also brought forth evil fruit.

56. And it came to pass that they went down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard.

57. And it came to pass that they beheld that the fruit of the natural branches had become corrupt also; yea, the first, and the second, and also the last; and they had all become corrupt:

58. And the wild fruit of the last, had overcome that part of the tree which brought forth good fruit, even that the branch had withered away and died.

59. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and sayeth unto the servant: What could I have done more for my vineyard?

60. Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it were these, had become corrupted, and now, these which have once brought forth good fruit, have also become corrupted;

61. And now, all the trees of my vineyard are good for nothing, save it be to be hewn down and cast into the fire!

62. And behold, this last, whose branch hath withered away, I did plant in a good spot of ground; yea, even that which was choice unto me, above all other parts of the land of my vineyard.

63. And thou beheldest that I also cut down that which cumbered this spot of ground, that I might plant this tree in the stead thereof.

64. And thou beheldest that a part thereof, brought forth good fruit; and a part thereof, brought forth wild fruit.

65. And because that I plucked not the branches thereof, and cast them into the fire, behold, they have overcome the good branch, that it hath withered away.

66. And now behold, notwithstanding all the care which we have taken of my vineyard, the trees thereof hath become corrupted, that they bring forth no good fruit:

67. And these I had hope to preserve, to have laid up fruit thereof, against the season, unto mine own self.

68. But behold, they have become like unto the wild olive tree; and they are of no worth, but to be hewn down and cast into the fire, and it grieveth me that I should lose them.

69. But what could I have done more in my vineyard? Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it?

70. Nay; I have nourished it, and I have digged it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost all the day long; and the end draweth nigh.

71. And it grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire, that they should be burned.

72. Who is it that hath corrupted my vineyard?

73. And it came to pass that the servant sayeth unto his master: Is it not the loftiness of thy vineyard? Hath not the branches thereof overcame the roots, which are good? And because that the branches have overcame the roots thereof?

74. For behold, they grew faster than the strength of the roots thereof, taking strength unto themselves; behold, I say, is not this the cause that the trees of thy vineyard hath become corrupted?

75. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant: Let us go to, and hew down the trees of the vineyard, and cast them into the fire, that they shall not cumber the ground of my vineyard; 

76. For I have done all, yea and what more could I have done more for my vineyard?

77. But behold, the servant saith unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare it a little longer.

78. And the Lord saith: Yea, I will spare it a little longer; for it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard; wherefore, let us take of the branches of these which I have planted in the nethermost parts of my vineyard, 

79. And let us graft them into the tree from whence they came, and let us pluck from the tree, those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in the natural branches of the tree, in the stead thereof.

80. And this will I do, that the tree may not perish, that perhaps I may preserve unto myself the roots thereof, for mine own purpose.

81. And behold, the roots of the natural branches of the tree which I planted whithersoever I would, are yet alive; 

82. Wherefore, that I may preserve them also, for mine own purpose, I will take of the branches of this tree, and I will graft them in unto them.

83. Yea, I will graft in unto them the branches of their mother tree (Shekinah), that I may preserve the roots also unto mine own self, that when they shall be sufficiently strong, that perhaps they may bring forth good fruit unto me, and I may yet have glory in the fruit of my vineyard. 

84. And it came to pass that they took from the natural tree which had become wild, and grafted in unto the natural trees, which also had become wild; and they also took of the natural trees which had become wild and grafted into their mother tree (Shekinah).

85. And the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant: Pluck not the wild branches from the trees, save it be those which are most bitter; and in them ye shall graft, according to that which I have said.

86. And we will nourish again the trees of the vineyard, and we will trim up the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the trees those branches which are ripened, that must perish, and cast them into the fire.

87. And this I do, that perhaps the roots thereof may take strength, because of their goodness; and because of the change of the branches, that the good may overcome the evil; 

88. And because that I have preserved the natural branches, and the roots thereof; and that I have grafted in the natural branches again, into their mother tree; 

89. And have preserved the roots of their mother tree (Shekinah), that perhaps the trees of my vineyard may bring forth again good fruit; and that I may have joy again in the fruit of my vineyard; 

90. And perhaps that I may rejoice exceedingly, that I have preserved the roots and the branches of the first fruit; 

91. Wherefore, go to, and call servants, that we may labor diligently with our might in the vineyard, that we may prepare the way, that I may bring forth again the natural fruit, which natural fruit is good, and the most precious above all other fruit.

92. Wherefore, let us go to, and labor with our might, this last time: for behold, the end draweth nigh; and this is for the last time that I shall prune my vineyard.

93. Therefore graft in the branches: begin at the last, that they may be first, and that the first may be last, and dig about the trees, both old and young, the first and the last, and the last and the first, that all may be nourished once again for the last time.

94. Wherefore, dig about them, and prune them, and dung them once more, for the last time, for the end draweth nigh, and if it so be that these last grafts shall grow, and bring forth the natural fruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that they may grow; 

95. And as they begin to grow, ye shall clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the good and the size thereof; 

96. And ye shall not clear away the bad thereof, all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard, for it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard; 

97. Wherefore, ye shall clear away the bad, according as the good shall grow, that the root and the top may be equal in strength, until the good shall overcome the bad, and the bad be hewn down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not the ground of my vineyard;

98. And thus will I sweep away the bad out of my vineyard, and the branches of the natural tree, will I graft in again, into the natural tree; and the branches of the natural tree, will I graft into the natural branches of the tree; 

99. And thus will I bring them together again, that they shall bring forth the natural fruit: and they shall be one.

100. And the bad shall be cast away; yea, even out of all the land of my vineyard: for behold, only this once will I prune my vineyard.

101. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him and brought other servants; and they were few.

102. And the Lord of the vineyard saith unto them: Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might; for behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard:,

103. For the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your mights with me, ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself, against the time which will soon come.

104. And it came to pass that the servants did go to it, and labor with their might; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them: and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard, in all things.

105. And there began to be the natural fruit again in the vineyard, and the natural branches began to grow and thrive exceedingly, and the wild branches began to be plucked off, and to be cast away; 

106. And they did keep the root and the top thereof, equal, according to the strength thereof.

107. And thus they labored, with all diligence, according to the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard, even until the bad had been cast away out of the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved unto himself, that the trees had become again the natural fruit; 

108. And they became like unto one body; and the fruit were equal; and the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto himself the natural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the beginning.

109. And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more corrupt, he calleth up his servants and sayeth unto them: Behold, for this last time have we nourished my vineyard; 

110. And thou beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have preserved the natural fruit, that it is good, even like as it was in the beginning; and blessed art thou.

111. For because that ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and hath brought unto me again the natural fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away, 

112. And behold, ye shall have joy with me, because of the fruit of my vineyard;

113. For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard unto mine own self, against the season, which speedily cometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; 

114. Wherefore I will lay up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to that which I have spoken.

115. And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my vineyard, then will I cause the good and the bad to be gathered; 

116. And the good will I preserve unto myself; and the bad will I cast away into its own place;

117. And then cometh the season and the end; and my vineyard will I cause to be burned with fire.

118. And in the day that YHVH shall set his hand again the second time to recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the qaddish (holy ones or saints) of YHVH shall go forth in his power, to nourish and prune his vineyard; and after that, the end soon cometh.

119. And how blessed are they who have labored diligently in His vineyard; and how cursed are they which shall be cast out into their own place, and the world shall be burned with fire.

chapter-aka: The Parable of the Banquet.

1. And it came to pass that I, Zenos, spoke again another parable in prophecy, saying: And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard had two sons, and the first was selfish, and would eat at foreign tables, learning the ways of idolaters and eating unclean food.

2. And the second was faithful and did only eat at his father’s table, and there in his father’s house he was permitted to remain.

3. And unto the faithful son did the Lord of the vineyard say: Let thy garments always be white and let not oil be wanting for thine head.

4. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard made for a banquet and invited all, even the travelers and strangers;

5. But the unfaithful son was told he should not come, not of his deed but by the wounding of his pride, and so he went away in shame;

6. Therefore, he did go about telling false rumors about his Father, the Lord of the vineyard.

7. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard hired a great number of laborers to work in his vineyard.

8. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard did gather the laborers taking them into the midst of his vineyard (pardes), yet he told them not what their wage should be by the work there, and this that the they might not be neglectful;

9. And it came to pass that when the evening was come the Lord of the vineyard did call each one of them, asking: Where within my vineyard didst thou labor?

10. And it came to pass that one answered unto him, saying: I labored in the east of the garden under a certain tree, and the Lord of the vineyard said: Unto thee shall be given a single gold piece.

11. And unto another who had labored in the west part of the garden under another tree, he said: Unto thee shall be given two hundred gold pieces;

12. And thus it was throughout all of his servants, each being given that which they were due.

13. And it came to pass that his servants came unto him saying: Why didst thou not say unto us the price of hire within thy vineyard? 

14. But the Lord of the vineyard answered them saying: How then should my vineyard be cared for? 

15. Wouldst not my servants only look after that part of my vineyard that giveth the greatest reward? And the rest of my vineyard would fall then to the wayside and should surely die?

16. But if thou shall be about my business, I shall see who doth care for the most precious parts of my vineyard, and when evening doth come I shall reward them.

17. And it came to pass that there was one among them who worked with much vigor, greater so than all the others, and yea even more than he was tasked.

18. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went forth and took this the good servant by the hand and walked about the vineyard and he did talk with him.

19. And it came to pass that when evening came, all the laborers came to the Lord of the vineyard to receive the reward of their labors;

20. And that good and faithful servant came with them, and the Lord of the vineyard paid him a full day’s wage.

21. And it came to pass that the other laborers complained one to another, saying: Behold we have worked from morn until eve while this that one hast worked but a few hours, and yet the master has given him a full day's pay?

22. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said: Who art thou to envy? 

23. Doth not the Law say: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor’s?

24. So too didst my good and faithful servant do more in a few hours than thou didst, who toiled all day.

25. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent word to all saying: Wash ye, make ye clean, and anoint yourselves, and wash your clothes and prepare yourselves for the banquet; yet he did not appoint a time.

26. And it came to pass that the faithful among them made themselves ready and waited at the entrance of the vineyard.

27. And these did say: In the Master’s vineyard, nothing will be wanting, and there need be no signs of preparation, yet the feast may be at any time.

28. And it came to pass that the foolish among them did prepare themselves not, for these did listen to the pride of the wicked son who set forth to place his name above that of the Lord of the vineyard.

29. And it came to pass that these foolish did say: There cannot be a great banquet without much commotion and trouble, and the gathering of stores and provisions; 

30. Therefore, we need not disturb ourselves until we see the signs; therefore, we shall be watchful of the signs that we may know.

31. And it came to pass that they joined themselves with their fellows, and thought not too feed the poor, but went away seeking after signs, and took no thought of the word of the Lord of the vineyard.

32. And each went about their way, and the foolish did make much gossip about those that stood ready, and did seek unto themselves the signs and wonders, reading much into nothing.

33. And it came to pass suddenly, the word of the Lord of the vineyard: Let all come to the banquet!

34. And the servants of the Master hastened the wise and the faithful and pressed them to come at the bidding of the Lord of the vineyard.

35. Then those that had prepared themselves, came in their honor and their glory, and those fools that had not prepared themselves, came in their pollution and uncleanliness.

36. And the faithful servant came last, for he stood ready and ensured that all were present and presented before the Lord of the vineyard.

37. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard did rejoice over the wise and faithful that had done according to his bidding, and who, moreover, had honored the beauty of His vineyard;

38. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard was angry with those who had taken no heed of his word, and who had polluted his vineyard with all the uncleanliness that clung about their garments, and who had treated it with contempt.

39. And it came to pass that these cried out saying: Let us in, for we went seeking thee, we looked for thy signs and wonders! 

40. Then the Lord of the vineyard came saying: Those that have prepared themselves for my presence, and were ready when I called, shall come and feast at my table, and those that did not prepare themselves shall not eat at the banquet;

41. And those that did not, but listened instead to my foolish son, were not prepared and therefore are not worthy.

42. And it came to pass that the wise among them thought that they might depart, for these were in fear of the great wrath of the Lord of the vineyard, 

43. And it came to pass that the Master replied: No, but ye shall stay in my vineyard, for ye are worthy of it, 

44. Yea, sit and eat at the banquet table; and eat and drink resting, while these stand upon their feet, and are smitten, and look on, distressed, and let thy garments at all times be white.

45. And it came to pass that after I had finished speaking, I stood in wonder over the banquet in the vineyard.

46. And it came to pass that as I stood wondering, the heavens were again opened unto me, and there I saw as it were a new heaven and a new earth, and I didst behold that the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.

47. And I saw as it were Zion{a}, the holy city, coming down from Elohim{b} out of heaven, and Shekinah{c} prepared as a bride adorned for Her husband{d}.
[a] Zion: Hebrew, “Tsiyyon” or “Tzion,” meaning “marking.” In Jewish law, if something is found with identifiable makings, that object must be returned to the owner. This would indicate that we, as the Church, belong to God by our marking as Zion, from the Mother through the Son. In Arabic, Zion means “defend.” 
[b] Elohim: “Gods.” Can denote the Godhead or Trinity as a whole, God the Father & Mother, or the Masculine and Feminine aspects of God. 
[c] Shekinah: Here the Church or the Congregation, the bride of Christ.
[d] Her husband: Here Jesus Christ, the Bridegroom. See Jeramiah 31:31-33; Isaiah 54:4-6, 3 Nephi 10:12-14 RAV, 22:4-6 OPV; Ezekiel 16:8-14, 60; Hosea 2:13-16.

48. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying: Behold, the temple of YHVH{e} is with Adam{f}, and YHVH shall dwell with them, and they shall be his people;
[e] YHVH: also known as the Tetragrammaton, translated as Yahweh, Jehovah, Yehovah, or LORD. See Doctrines of the Saints 45e. 
[f] Adam: Hebrew, “mankind.”

49. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

50. And I saw as it were They that sat upon the throne saying: Behold, I make all things new; therefore prepare thyselves for that which is to come; So mote it be; even so, Amen, and Amen.

51. And the vision was closed unto me, and the angel of YHVH said unto me: All these things that thou hast seen are of the heavens, 

52. For all things happen in the realm of the heavens at the first, and then upon the earth, that all things be as one.

53. Therefore I, Zenos, say unto thee, prepare ye for the great and dreadful day of YHVH! 

54. Yea, keep thy garments clean and stand ready for the day when the earth and the heavens shall again be one.
