chapter-aka: Israel in Bondage

1. The Testament of Moses{a}, written after Israel had gone forth from the World{b} to wander in the wilderness{c};
[a] Hebrew, from the Hebrew verb meaning "to pull out" or "to draw out" (of water)
[b] In the physical sense, Egypt, in the spiritual sense, leaving behind the things of the earth for a spiritual awakening
[c] Hebrew: "mouth." In a spiritual sense, a place between the physical plain and the spiritual plain of existence

2. The Exodus that was made by Moses in fulfillment of the prophecies{a} given by our fathers, Jacob and Joseph:
[a] 2 Moses 15:26-28, 20:8, and 35:29-31

3. The writings that were made by Moses and given unto Joshua, the son of Nun, a man approved of YHVH{a}, that he might be a safety for Israel, and of the tabernacle of YHVH, and its ark, with all its holy things,
[a] See YHVH

4. That he might bring Israel out of that wilderness and into the land given to our mothers and our fathers,

5. That those lands should be given to them according to the covenant{a} and the oath, which YHVH spoke unto Abraham and Sarah.
[a] 1 Moses 27:14

6. ¶ Now these are the names of the children of Jacob which came into Egypt, everyone according to his household who came with Jacob:

7. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Dinah, and Benjamin.

8. And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob into Egypt were seventy in all; for Joseph was already in Egypt.

9. ¶ And it came to pass that Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation;

10. And all of Israel{a} were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding strong; and the land was filled with them.
[a] Refers to all those of the covenant, not necessarily the literal children of Jacob; see Israel

11. And it came to pass that there arose up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph,

12. And he said unto his people: Behold! The people of Israel are more and mightier than we;

13. Come; let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us; and so get them up out of the land.

14. And it came to pass that Israel{a} did the work of the men of Egypt day by day, and the Egyptians afflicted Israel that they should to lessen them in the land;
[a] Refers to all those of the covenant, not necessarily the literal children of Jacob

15. And yet as the Egyptians increased upon Israel their labor, YHVH Elohim{a} did increase Israel and they did multiply, until all the land of Goshen was filled with the Israelites;
[a] See YHVH Elohim

16. And Pharaoh saw that his counsel did fail against Israel, and that they increased and grew until Israel was numerous in the lands,

17. But Pharaoh knew not YHVH, the Elohim{a} of Israel, and so he would not relent.
[a] See Elohim

18. ¶ And it came to pass that they did set over them task-masters to afflict them with their burdens; and Israel did build for Pharaoh many works, and even storehouses to hold his treasures.

19. But the more they afflicted Israel, the stronger they became, and thus were the Egyptians grieved because of Israel.

20. And the Egyptians did force upon Israel, making them to serve, working them with even greater severity:

21. And they did make their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field; all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah{a} and the name of the other Puah{b};
[a] Hebrew, "fair one," or "beautiful"
[b] Hebrew, "young girl"

23. And he said: When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

24. But the midwives feared Ha’Elohim{a} and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
[a] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

25. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them: Why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive?

26. And the midwives said unto Pharaoh: Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them;

27. Therefore, Elohim dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and waxed very strong.

28. ¶ And it came to pass, because the midwives feared Ha’Elohim, that He made them houses.

29. But Pharaoh charged all his people, saying: Every son that is born unto Israel, ye shall cast into the river; and every daughter ye shall save alive.

chapter-aka: Mercy is Given to Israel

1. And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and it came to pass that Levi grew even to the one hundred thirty and seventh degree.

2. And the sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimi, according to the genealogies.

3. And the sons of Kohath were Amram{a}, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and Kohath grew to the one hundred thirty and third degree.
[a] Hebrew, "Friend of the most high" or "The people are exalted"

4. And the sons of Merari were Mahali and Mushi; these are the families of Levi according to their generations.

5. ¶ And it came to pass that Amram, a man of the house of Levi, took him Yochebed{a}, the sister of his father and a daughter of Levi, to wife;
[a] Hebrew, "YHVH is glory"

6. And the woman{a} conceived and bore a daughter before the charge of Pharaoh, and they did name her Miriam{b}, for bitter were the days of Israel.
[a] Yochebed
[b] Hebrew, "sea of bitterness," Egyptian, "beloved"

7. And it came to pass that Amram did know his wife, Yochebed, again, and she conceived and bore a son in the same year{a} as the charged of Pharaoh unto the midwives,
[a] See 3 Moses 1:22-23

8. And they did name him Aaron{a}, for Israel did need strength; for Pharaoh had begun to spill the blood of Israel.
[a] Hebrew, "Aharon," "high mountain," "mountain of strength," "exalted," "enlightened," or "bearer of martyrs"

9. ¶ And it came to pass that Miriam grew, and was filled with the breath{a} of Ha’Elohim{b}; and it came to pass that she dreamed a dream,
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] See Ha'Elohim

10. And in it she did see the malak{a}, Haniel{b}, clothed in fine linen, and he spoke unto her, saying: Speak unto thy father and thy mothers, saying: I am coming, and shall be born unto them,
[a] Hebrew, "angel," see Malak
[b] Hebrew, "Joy of God" or "Grace of God;" see Haniel

11. And I shall come out of the waters{a}, and wonders and miracles shall I perform in the name of El Elyon{b}, that Israel should be free.
[a] Hebrew, "to draw out" (of water)
[b] See El Eyon

12. And in the morning she did prophecy and say unto all those in the house of her father: A son shall be born unto this house, and behold! He shall deliver Israel from out of Egypt!

13. And her father, Amram, feared this saying: The Egyptians should hear this! and he forbid it; but her mother, Yochebed, she did carry these words in her heart.

14. ¶ And it came to pass that Amram did know his wife, Yochebed, again, and she conceived and bore a son, and they did not name him, but when she saw him, that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

15. And when it was that Yochebed could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with tar and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the brink of the river.

16. And his sister, Miriam, stood afar off to know what would be done to him, for she did remember the words given her by Ha’Elohim{a}.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

17. ¶ And it came to pass that the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side;

18. And when the daughter of Pharaoh saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maidservant to fetch it.

19. And when she had opened it, she saw the child; and behold, the babe wept.

20. And she had compassion on the boy, saying: This is one of the Hebrew children.

21. Then Miriam, the sister of Moses stood up, and revealed herself, saying to the daughter of the Pharaoh: Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?

22. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her: Go.

23. And Miriam did go and called upon their mother, Yochebed.

24. And the daughter of Pharaoh said unto the mother of the boy: Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.

25. And Yochebed did take her child and nursed him.

26. ¶ And it came to pass that the child grew, and Yochebed brought him unto the daughter of the Pharaoh; and he became her son.

27. And she called his name Moses{a}; and she said: Because I drew him out of the water; but she knew not that this was even as his fathers, Jacob and Joseph, and his sister, Miriam, had prophesied.
[a] Hebrew, from the Hebrew verb meaning "to pull out" or "to draw out" (of water)

28. And Moses was even as a prince in Egypt, and learned all of the ways of the Egyptians, even unto the ways of battles and he was a leader of armies;

29. And so it was that Moses was trusted by Pharaoh, because of his love for his daughter:

30. Yet Moses too was taught also by his mother, in all the ways of Israel.

31. ¶ And it came to pass that when Moses was grown, he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens; and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.

32. And Moses looked this way and that way; and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

33. ¶ And it came to pass that when Moses went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together; and he said to him that did the wrong: Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

34. And he said: Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Intendest thou to kill me as thou killedst{a} the Egyptian?
[a] See 3 Moses 2:32

35. And Moses feared and said: Surely this thing is known.

36. And when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.

37. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses did flee from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and there he did dwell by a well.

38. Now Jethro{a}, the High Priest of El Elyon{b} in Midian, had seven daughters; and they came, and drew water, and filled the troughs to water the flock of their father;
[a] Hebrew, "His Excellence;" Moses’ father-in-law has seven names or titles: "Reuel," "Jether," "Jethro," "Hobab," "Heber," "Keni," and "Putiel"
[b] Hebrew, "The Most High God;" see El Elyon

39. And when the shepherds came in and began to drive them away, Moses arose and helped them, and he did water their flock.

40. And when the daughters came to Reuel{a}, Jethro, their father, he said: How is it that ye are come so soon today?
[a] Hebrew, "friend of God;" A name or title for Jethro, a High Priest of El Elyon

41. And they said: An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

42. And Jethro did say unto his daughters: And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man behind? Call on him, that he may eat bread.

43. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah{a}, his daughter, the High Priestess, in marriage.
[a] Hebrew, "bird" reminiscent of the fierce loyalty to her husband; wife of Moses and High Priestess of El Elyon

44. ¶ And it came to pass that Zipporah bore a son; and they called his name Gershom{a}, said Moses: I have been a stranger in a strange land.
[a] Hebrew, "a sojourner there," or "a stranger there"

45. ¶ And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died; and Israel sighed by reason of the bondage; and they cried, and their cry came up unto Ha’Elohim by reason of the bondage.

46. And Elohim{a} heard their groaning, and YHVH{b} did remember His Covenant with the fathers of Israel; even with Abraham, and with Isaac, and with Jacob:
[a] See Elohim
[b] See YHVH

47. And Ha’Elohim looked upon the children, and YHVH acknowledged them.

chapter-aka: The Voice

1. And it came to pass that Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, Reuel{a} —the priest of Midian;
[a] Hebrew, "friend of God;" a name or title for Jethro, a High Priest of El Elyon

2. And he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the Mount of Ha’Elohim{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim

3. And there did the angel of YHVH{a} appear unto him, in a flame of fire within the very center of the bush.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

4. And Moses looked; and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed;

5. And Moses said: I will now turn aside and see this marvelous sight—why is this bush not consumed?

6. And when YHVH{a} saw that Moses turned aside to see, Elohim{b} called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said: Moses, Moses!
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

7. And Moses said: Here am I.

8. And Moses heard the Voice{a} from the bush, saying: Draw not nigh hither; but put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
[a] Hebrew masculine noun, referring here to the Holy Spirit; see Ruach HaKodesh

9. And the Voice continued, saying: I am the Elohim of thy father, the Elohim of Abraham, and the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob.

10. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon Ha’Elohim{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim

11. ¶ And YHVH said: I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their afflictions;

12. And I am come down to deliver them from out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and plenteous land,

13. Yea, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

14. Now, therefore, behold, the cry of my child, Israel is come unto me; and I have also seen how severely the Egyptians do squeeze them.

15. Go now, therefore; for I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, my children, Israel, out of Egypt.

16. ¶ And then Moses said unto Ha’Elohim: Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth thy children, Israel, out of Egypt?

17. And the Voice said: Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token{a} unto thee that I have sent thee:
[a] Or "sign;" a Hebrew eminine noun representing the will to receive; see Token

18. When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve Ha’Elohim upon this mountain.

19. And Moses said unto Ha’Elohim: Behold, when I come unto thy children, Israel, and shall say unto them: The Elohim of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say to me: By what name? what shall I say unto them?

20. And Ha’Elohim said unto Moses: Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh{a} (I AM THAT I AM);
[a] The Creator, or "I AM that I AM," or "I AM (the One) that Makes/ Creates;" see Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

21. ¶ And the Voice said: Thus shalt thou say unto Israel: The Creator{a} hath sent me unto you.
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

22. And Elohim said unto Moses moreover: Thus shalt thou say unto my children, Israel: YHVH, the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob, hath sent me unto you;

23. And this is my name: Everlasting{a}, and by this name shall I be known and remembered unto all generations.
[a] Hebrew, "El'Olam," one of the names of God; see El'Olam

24. ¶ Go, and gather the men of the Elders of Israel together, and say unto them: YHVH the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying: I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;

25. And I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

26. And they shall hearken to thy voice; and thou shalt come, thou and the men of the Elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt;

27. And ye shall say unto him: YHVH, the Elohim of the Hebrews, hath met with us; and now let us go, we beseech thee, and journey three days' into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to YHVH, our Elohim.

28. And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless he is compelled by a mighty hand;

29. Therefore, is shall give unto thee my sword{a}, that I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with the many wonders which I will do in the midst thereof;
[a] Hebrew, "chereb," meaning sword or tool, likely referring to the power of God; see 4 Moses 30-36, "The Chereb of Moses"

30. And after that Pharaoh will let you go, and I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.

31. And it shall come to pass that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty; but every woman shall ask of her neighbor and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment;

32. And ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters; and ye shall plunder the Egyptians.

chapter-aka: The Rod and the Witness

1. And Moses answered and said: But, behold, they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say: YHVH{a} hath not appeared unto thee.
[a] See YHVH

2. And the angel of YHVH{a} said unto him: What is that in thine hand?
[a] See Angel of YHVH

3. And Moses answered him, saying: A rod{a}.
[a] Likely shepherd's or walking staff; see Rod

4. And the Voice{a} said: Pray over it, and bless it, even as thou wast showed when thou was given the Chereb{b}, that it shall be a tool{b} unto thee for a mighty work in my name,
[a] Masculine noun, referring here to the Holy Spirit; see Ruach Hakodesh
[b] Hebrew, "sword" or "tool," likely referring to the power of God; see 4 Moses 30-36, "The Chereb of Moses"

5. That Israel may believe that YHVH, the Elohim{a} of their fathers, the Elohim of Abraham, the Elohim of Isaac, and the Elohim of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
[a] See Elohim

6. And Moses prayed over the rod, and he blessed it, and in the name YHVH did he bless the rod.

7. And the Voice said: Cast the rod on the ground, and the angel of YHVH did place his finger upon it, and said unto Moses: Place it in thy right hand, for it is holy unto YHVH.

8. And Moses picked up the rod, and the Voice said: Cast the rod on the ground.

9. And when Moses cast it on the ground, lo{a}! it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
[a] See Hinneh

10. And the angel of YHVH said unto Moses: Now, put forth thine hand and take it by the tail.

11. And Moses put forth his hand and caught it, and it became again a rod in his hand.

12. ¶ And the angel of YHVH said furthermore unto him: Put now thine left hand into thy bosom.

13. And holding the rod in his right hand, Moses put his left hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was as snow.

14. And the Voice said: Put thy hand into thy bosom again.

15. And Moses put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom; and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

16. And the Voice said: It shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the Voice of the first sign, that they will believe the Voice of the latter sign.

17. And it shall come to pass that if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, thou shalt take of the water of the river and tap it with thy rod, and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

18. ¶ And Moses said unto the angel of YHVH: O my Lord{a}, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.
[a] Hebrew, "Adonai," "Lord;" Moses is speaking to the angel of YHVH

19. And the angel of YHVH said unto him: Who hath made the mouth of man? Or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? Was it not the Creator{a} Himself, YHVH?
[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh

20. Now, therefore, go; and the Breath{a} will be in thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

21. And Moses said unto the angel of YHVH: O my Lord, there in Egypt did I slay a man, and Pharaoh{a} doth seek my life!
[a] See 3 Moses 2:28

22. And the angel of YHVH said unto Moses: Go; return into Egypt; for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

23. ¶ And Moses said: O my Lord, I pray thee, another hand wilt thou send?

24. And the anger of YHVH was kindled against Moses and the Voice said: Is not Aaron, the Levite, thy brother? I know that he can speak well;

25. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

26. And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do;

27. And thy spokesman he shall be unto the people; and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth; and thou shalt be his elohim{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "judges" or "rulers"

28. And the angel of YHVH said unto Moses: Thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs;

29. And when thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thine hand; and I will prosper thee;

30. But behold, I shall harden the heart of Pharaoh{a}, and Pharaoh will harden his heart, and he will not let my children go, that Israel shall see and should remember all that I do for her:
[a] A way of saying that God is in control of all situations

31. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh: Thus saith YHVH: Israel is my firstborn child;

32. And I say unto thee: Let my children go that they may serve me; and if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

33. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses went, and returned to Jethro, his father-in-law, and thinking that he should not let him take his daughter out of that land,

34. And Moses said unto him: Let me go, I pray thee, and let me return with thy daughter, who is my wife, unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.

35. And Jethro said to Moses: Go in peace; for Jethro the Reuel knew Moses place in these things by the breath of Ha’Elohim{a}.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

36. And it came to pass Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass, to return to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of Ha’Elohim in his hand.

chapter-aka: The Lifeblood of Moses

1. And it came to pass that as Moses traveled, he did yet fear that he was traveling to his death by the hands of a new Pharaoh; therefore, he did try to plot a way out from his mitzvah{a}.
[a] Hebrew, a precept or religious duty

2. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{a} appeared unto Moses as he was in the way, by an inn and did remind him of his duty in wrath;
[a] See Angel of YHVH

3. And the angel of YHVH did say unto Moses: And what should thou say, and whither should thou goest now that thou should flee YHVH Elohim{a}?
[a] See YHVH Elohim

4. For thou hath been called{a}, and thy excuses have been vain; therefore, there is but one more excuse that thou might give to flee thy duty before YHVH;
[a] Hebrew, "yasad;" "appointed," "established," or "fixed"

5. Therefore, should I kill thee that Egypt should be saved from the wrath of YHVH{a}? And that the salvation of thy brother, Israel, not be given? Would thou give up thy life for this?
[a] See YHVH

6. ¶ And YHVH was angry with Moses, and Moses feared that the hand of YHVH{a} was about to fall upon him to kill him; for Moses did see Mal’akh Ha’Mavet{b} by the side;
[a] "The Hand of Creation," or "the Hand of the Creator;" God’s all powerful hand that at times shows mercy, and others judgment; see Isaiah 19:16, 51:17, 66:2.
[b] Hebrew, "angel of death;" see Mal’akh Ha’Mavet

7. And Moses, not wishing Zipporah, his wife, to know is shame, did say unto her: I fear that Ha’Elohim{a} should kill me, for we left suddenly and in haste, and did not damage{b} our new born, this is the way of my people;
[a] See Ha' Elohim
[b] Hebrew, "mul;" referring to cutting off a part of the foreskin of the penis; see Circumcision

8. And thus in his pride he did try to hide is troubles from his wife.

9. And Moses had truly not circumcised his son, yet it was the heart of Moses, and his unwillingness to heed the call and the Voice{a} that YHVH had given him that had angered Ha’Elohim,
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

10. And for this, Ha’Elohim did send the angel of YHVH and Mal’akh Ha’Mavet to visit him, that the wrath of YHVH should be made known unto him.

11. And so it was that Moses spoke unto his wife, Zipporah, saying: Surely we must damage our son, least YHVH should kill me!

12. ¶ But Zipporah too saw the angel of YHVH and had heard the word of YHVH, she being a High Priestess, and prophetess of El Elyon{a};
[a] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon

13. And thus she knew that the anger YHVH was kindled against her husband for his unwillingness.

14. And Zipporah too was angry with Moses, and thus it was that she went out about the ground in search of a sharp{a} stone.
[a] Or "rugged"

15. And it came to pass that Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut herself, and cast the stone at the feet of Moses, saying: Thou art now a bridegroom{a} of blood by circumcision{b}.
[a] Or "husband."
[b] Or "by mutilation," or by my damage"

16. And Zipporah said further unto her husband: Thou art the lifeblood of me, and our bond is sealed, my husband, by my father, who is Reuel; and thou and I are one;

17. Therefore, whatsoever duty Ha’Elohim hath given thee, YHVH hath given me also; for am I not a High Priestess unto YHVH?

18. ¶ And Moses was ashamed, and hid his face from YHVH, and said: I have sinned before YHVH;

19. And from that time forward, Moses did forgo his pity, and remembered his duty to YHVH.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH did bless them; and YHVH spared Moses and let him go because Zipporah, his wife, had honored her call and would circumcise the heart{a} of Israel.
[a] See Deuteronomy 30:6, Romans 2:29

21. And the Voice came unto Moses and Zipporah, saying: Take ye that stone, and bless it with thy chereb, and keep it in remembrance of thy covenant between yourselves and me:

22. For the blood of the High Priestess of El Elyon be upon it, and the humility of the High Priest of YHVH be upon it;

23. And thy blood I did not require of thee, yet it was freely given of thee, my servant Zipporah; thereby this stone shall be kept as a remembrance of the covenant both ye have made unto YHVH this day.

24. And Moses and Zipporah did bless the stone, and when they lifted up their hands from it, they saw that it had grown red{a} in color, and had become like that of a ruby.
[a] In Kabbalah red signifies fire, strength, and judgment

25. And the angel of YHVH spoke unto them, saying: This is now thy segula{a}, guard it well, for it shall be unto you as a protection.
[a] Hebrew feminine noun, "remedy," "protection," or "treasured possession;" see Segula

26. ¶ And it came to pass that they did circumcise their son that day, after the manner of Israel, and the heart of Moses too was circumcised;

27. And Zipporah did keep her covenant and raised their children unto YHVH, and was a support{a} unto Moses, her husband, in all things.
[a] Or "blessing," or "benefit"

chapter-aka: The Mountain of Strength

1. And it came to pass that not many days before Moses was in the presence of the angel of YHVH{a}, in a flame of fire within the very center of that bush, that the angel of YHVH did come unto Aaron, the brother of Moses;
[a] See Angel of YHVH

2. And the angel of YHVH did say unto Aaron: Go ye into the wilderness to meet thy brother, Moses;

3. For unto thee is given a call{a}, even to be the mouthpiece of thy brother; and he shall be as elohim{b} unto thee, and thou shalt be an ensign for him; and this ye shall do, for it is thy duty{c} before Ha’Elohim{d}.
[a] Hebrew, "yasad;" "appointed," "fixed" or "established"
[b] Hebrew, typically "gods;" here "judges" or "rulers," referring to Moses as an emissary between God and Aaron
[c] Hebrew, mitzvah; a commandment or precept; a religious duty
[d] See Ha'Elohim

4. Now Aaron had take him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she did bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

5. And it came to pass that after Aaron did hear the words of the angel of YHVH that he got himself up and left his family with much hast, and went whichever way the Voice{a} did command him.
[a] The Holy Spirit; see Ruach HaKodesh

6. And this is the manner by which all men and women are called to serve YHVH{a};
[a] See YHVH

7. Not by the desires their hearts, but by the Voice of El Elyon{a}; and this that the will of YHVH should be made known unto mankind{b}.
[a] See El Elyon
[b] Adam: Hebrew, mankind

8. And it came to pass that Aaron went and met Moses and Zipporah in the mount of Ha’Elohom, in the mount where the angel of YHVH had appeared unto him;

9. And there Moses wept to see his brother, Aaron kissed Moses, his brother.

10. And Moses told Aaron and Zipporah all the words of YHVH who had sent him, and he showed unto them all the signs which he had been commanded, and behold, they believed!

11. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah then went away from Aaron, even as the Voice commanded them, and Aaron was left unto himself.

12. And it came to pass that when Moses and Zipporah did reach the bush that burned from the very center, yet did not catch fire, there they saw the angel of YHVH;

13. And the angel of YHVH spoke unto them, saying: I have come for thee, and Elohim hath given me charge to bring thee to the throne.

14. But Moses spoke, saying: We are but flesh and blood, and cannot look upon the countenance!

15. And the angel of YHVH placed his hands over the faces of Moses and Zipporah, yet did not touch them, and their flesh became as fire, and their eyes were opened{a};
[a] Unlike Adam and Eve, Moses and Zipporah were given permission to have their eyes opened. See 1 Moses 5:16, 44; Genesis 3:5-7, 22

16. And there before them they saw ten thousand upon ten thousand{a} angels, some singing praises unto YHVH, some with swords in their arms, and others with scrolls.
[a] Or "myriad upon myriad"

17. And YHVH spoke unto them, saying: Moses, Zipporah; thou has found favor in the site of Elohim; therefore, fear not, and be be not afraid.

18. And Moses was calm.

19. And they were each given six wings{a} with which to cover their faces, that they gaze not upon the Shekinah, and to do the service of YHVH.
[a] Six wings are given to those that serve to maintain holiness; according to Isaiah 6:2, the seraphim have six wings; two to cover the face, two to cover the feet, and two to fly

20. And there before the throne of Yah{a} and of YHVH Moses and Zipporah did learn all ten mysteries and were given the cherebm.
[a] Hebrew Yod (Father) and Hai (Mother); see Yah

21. Moses spoke to Ha’Elohim, saying: I cannot bear to leave thy Presence{a}!
[a] See Shekinah

22. And YHVH replied: Bring my people here that I might give them my Torah{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "Law," "Instructions," or "Teachings"

23. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah came down from that mountain, and they did take their two sons, and went with Aaron, back into the land of Egypt.

24. And, in the land of Egypt, there they spoke unto Miriam, the sister of Moses,

25. And to her did Moses give all the words of YHVH who had sent him and did show unto her all the signs which he had been commanded, and lo! Miriam did believe on the words of her brother.

26. ¶ And And it came to pass that Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the men of the Elders of Israel and the High Priests;

27. And now Aaron spoke all the words which YHVH had spoken unto Moses and did give all the signs in the sight of the High Priests, and the Elders among them, the fathers, and the sons; yea, all the men of Israel.

28. And it came to pass that after seeing the water turned to blood, that even the most unbelieving did believe the words of Aaron.

29. And it came to pass that Zipporah and Miriam did go unto women, the High Priestesses, the Elders among them, the mothers, and the daughters; yeah, even all the daughters of Israel.

30. And Miriam did speak all the words which YHVH had spoken unto Moses, for Zipporah was as a stranger among them; and Miriam did tell the signs that they did see unto the women.

31. And the people believed, both the men and the women; and when YHVH saw, He blessed the daughters of Israel, for they believed without requiring a sign{a}.
[a] See John 20:29

32. And when Israel heard that YHVH had visited His children, and did looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped as one{a}.

chapter-aka: The Burden of Israel

1. And it came to pass that not many days after this, Moses and Aaron went and spoke unto Pharaoh, saying:

2. Thus saith YHVH{a}, the Elohim{b} of Israel: Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

3. And Pharaoh replied unto them: Who is YHVH, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not YHVH, neither will I let Israel go.

4. And Aaron said: The Elohim of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice unto YHVH, our Elohim, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.

5. And the king of Egypt said unto them: Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, lead the people from their works? Get you unto your burdens.

6. And Pharaoh said: Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.

7. ¶ And it came to pass in that day the same did Pharaoh command the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying:

8. Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.

9. And the tale{a} of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof, for they be idle; therefore, they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our Elohim.
[a] Or "measure of the bricks;" the length of bricks when laid out in rows

10. Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard these deceptions.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying: Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

12. Go ye, get your straw where ye can find it; yet not aught of your work shall be diminished.

13. So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

14. And the taskmasters hasted them, saying: Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

15. And the officers of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and demanded: Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and today, as heretofore?

16. Then the officers of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying: Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

17. There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us: Make brick; and behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.

18. But Pharaoh answered them, saying: Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore, ye say: Let us go and do sacrifice to YHVH.

19. Go, therefore, now and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

20. And the officers of Israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said: Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks of your daily task.

21. And these very officers met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh;

22. And they said unto them: YHVH look upon you and judge for ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses returned unto YHVH and said: Lord{a}, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? Is this why thou hast sent me?
[a] Adonai: Hebrew, "Lord;" see Adonai

24. For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

25. Then YHVH said unto Moses: Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let Israel go, and with a strong hand shall he drive Israel out of his land.

26. And Elohim spoke unto Moses and said unto him: I am YHVH; and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob.

27. I am YHVH, Elohim Shaddai{a}, the Lord YEHOVAH{b}; and was not my name known unto them?
[a] Elohim Shaddai: Hebrew, "Gods Almighty," or the Almighty Gods;" see Elohim Shaddai
[b] See YHVH

28. Yea, and I have also established my covenant with them, which I made with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

29. And I have also heard the groaning of my children, Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

30. Wherefore, say unto my children, Israel: I am YHVH; and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments;

31. And I will take you unto myself for a people, and I will be your Elohim; and ye shall know that I am YHVH, your Elohim, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

32. And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage; I, YHVH, will do it; even so must it be.

chapter-aka: The Plague of Blood

1. And it came to pass that Moses spake so unto Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage.

2. And YHVH{a} spake unto Moses, saying: I have made thee as one of the elohim{b} over Pharaoh, and Aaron as thy prophet{c}:
[a] See YHVH
[b] Hebrew, "judges" or "rulers"
[c] Spokeman for Moses

3. Go in, therefore; speak unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let my children, Israel, go out of his land.

4. And Moses spake before YHVH, saying: Behold, thy children, Israel, have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who is of uncircumcised lips?

5. And YHVH spake unto Moses and unto Aaron and gave them a charge unto Israel and unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring Israel out of the land of Egypt.

6. ¶ Now, so it was that on the day the angel of YHVH{a} spake unto Moses, that YHVH did command Moses that he should speak unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, saying: I, YHVH, will do unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say unto thee.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

7. And Moses said before YHVH: Behold, I am of stammering lips and slow of speech; how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

8. And YHVH said unto Moses: See, I have made thee a prophet and a seer{a} before Pharaoh; and Aaron, thy brother, shall be thy spokesman.
[a] See Seer

9. Thou shalt speak unto thy brother all that I command thee; and Aaron, thy brother, shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send my children, Israel, out of his land.

10. And Pharaoh will harden his heart, as I said unto thee; and thou shalt use thy chereb{a} that I have given thee and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
[a] See Chereb

11. But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; therefore, I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth mine armies, my people, my children, Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

12. And the Egyptians shall know that I am YHVH when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt and bring out my children from among them.

13. ¶ And so it was that on this day that Moses and Aaron did as YHVH commanded them; so did they.

14. And YHVH spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying: Show a miracle that I may know you;

15. Then thou shalt say unto Aaron: Take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

16. And it came to pass that Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so even as YHVH had commanded;

17. And Aaron cast down his rod{a} before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
[a] See Rod

18. And it came to pass that Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers{a}; now the magicians{b} of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments, and they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents;
[a] Hebrew, "kashaph;" practicing magick or priestcraft; see Priestcraft
[b] Hebrew: "chartom;" an "engraver" or "writer," likely of spells; see Priestcraft

19. But behold! The rod of Aaron came up its way, slithering and swallowed up their rods.

20. And Pharaoh hardened his heart, that he hearkened not unto them, even as YHVH had said.

21. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses: the heart of Pharaoh is hardened; he refuseth to let my people go;

22. Therefore, get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the brink of the river until he comes; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

23. And thou shalt say unto him: YHVH, Elohim{a} of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying: Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness; and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
[a] See Elohim

24. Thus saith YHVH: In this thou shalt know that I am YHVH; behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the Nile{a}, and they shall be turned to blood;
[a] Literally, "in the water" as Nile is the Egyptian word for water

25. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the Nile.

26. And YHVH spake unto Moses: Say unto Aaron: Take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt and place my curse upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water;

27. That they may become blood, and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.

28. ¶ And it came to pass that on the morrow Moses and Aaron did so, even as YHVH commanded;

29. And Aaron lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

30. And the fish that was in the river died, and the river stank; and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

31. And the magicians of Egypt got them new water, which they did dig up from the ground, and they even did the same with their enchantments, but they could not make their water clean again.

32. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them, as YHVH had said.

33. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house; neither did he set his heart to this also.

34. And all people of the Egypt dug round about the river for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the river, but the Hebrews did have fresh water in their vessels.

chapter-aka: The Plague of Frogs

1. And it came to pass that seven days were fulfilled after that YHVH{a} had smitten the river that YHVH rested and the Nile{b} was returned.
[a] See YHVH
[b] Or "the water"

2. And YHVH spake unto Moses on that day, saying: Go unto Pharaoh and say unto him: Thus saith YHVH: Let my people go, that they may serve me;

3. And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs;

4. And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading troughs;

5. And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants, but unto the Hebrews these shall not be.

6. And YHVH spake unto Moses: Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod{a} over the Nile and place my curse over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
[a] See Rod

7. ¶ And it came to pass that on that same day, the seventh day from the first plague, that Moses and Aaron did go before Pharaoh and did say all the things that YHVH did command them;

8. But seeing that the blood was gone from the waters, Pharaoh refused them.

9. And when Pharaoh refused them, Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, even as YHVH had commanded him through His servant, Moses;

10. And it came to pass that the frogs did came up, they and covered the land of Egypt, even as Aaron commanded.

11. And it came to pass that, not wanted to be undone, the magicians{a} of Egypt did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt, that the Egyptians were overwhelmed.
[a] Hebrew: chartom;" an "engraver" or "writer," likely of spells; see Doctrines of the Saints 106:1-35, Priestcraft

12. ¶ And it came to pass that Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said: Entreat YHVH, that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto YHVH.

13. And Moses said unto Pharaoh: It shall be even as thou say, and thy glory{a} be over me.
[a] Or "You have honor over me"

14. When shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people to destroy{a} the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?
[a] Or "kill"

15. And Pharaoh answered him, saying: Tomorrow.

16. And Moses said: Be it even according to thy word, that thou mayest know that there is none like unto YHVH, our Elohim{a};
[a] See Elohim

17. And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy{a} people; they shall remain in the river only.
[a] While the text does not come out and say it, this implies that the frogs where not where the Hebrews lived

18. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto YHVH because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

19. And YHVH did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died—yea, out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

20. And the people gathered them together upon heaps; and the land stank.

21. But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite against him for the smell there of, he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them, as YHVH had said.

1. And it came to pass that when Pharaoh did refuse Israel, the Moses and Aaron went unto Pharaoh, but he would not grant them audience;

2. Therefore, Moses went again unto YHVH{a}, pleading.
[a] See YHVH

3. And YHVH said unto Moses: Say unto Aaron: Stretch out thy rod{a} and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice{b} throughout all the land of Egypt.
[a] See Rod
[b] Hebrew, "swarm;" lice, gnats, and/or fleas

4. And Moses spake unto his brother, Aaron, and he did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth; and it became lice upon the people and upon beast;

5. And all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that Pharaoh did learn of Aaron’s doing, and did call all his wisemen{a}, and his sorcerers{b}, and his magicians{c};
[a] Hebrew, "chakam;" experts, sages, or skilled men
[b] Hebrew, "kashaph;" those that practice magick or priestcraft. See Doctrines of the Saints 106:1-35, Priestcraft
[c] Hebrew: "chartom;" an "engraver" or "writer," likely of spells. See Doctrines of the Saints 106:1-35, Priestcraft

7. And the magicians did make an attempt to do so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not, nor could they remove the lice;

8. And so there were lice upon the people and upon the beasts, save it were the Hebrews that did dwell in the land of Egypt.

9. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh: This is the finger of Ha'Elohim{a}; and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, even as YHVH had said.

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} said unto Moses: Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh;

2. Lo, he cometh forth to the water{a}; and say unto him: Thus saith YHVH: Let my people go, that they may serve me;
[a] Or "Nile"

3. Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms{a} upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses;
[a] Some a large group of biting or stinging insects

4. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms, and also the ground whereon they are.

5. And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms shall be there—to this end thou mayest know that I am YHVH in the midst of the earth.

6. And I will put a division between my people and thy people; tomorrow shall this sign be.

7. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH did so; and there came a grievous swarm into the house of Pharaoh, and into the houses of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt; the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms.

8. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said: Go ye; sacrifice to your God in the land.

9. And Moses said: It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to YHVH, our Elohim{a}.
[a] See Elohim

10. Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

11. We will go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to YHVH, our Elohim, even as He shall command us.

12. And Pharaoh said: I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to YHVH, your Elohim, in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away; entreat for me.

13. And Moses said: Behold, I go out from thee; and I will entreat YHVH that the swarms may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow;

14. But let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to YHVH.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated YHVH.

16. And YHVH did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

17. And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also; neither would he let the people go.

4. And it came to pass that YHVH appointed a set time, saying: Tomorrow YHVH shall send Mal’akh Ha’Mavet{a} to do this thing in the land.
[a] The angel of death, see Mal’akh Ha’Mavet

5. ¶ And it came to pass that on the morrow that YHVH did send Mal’akh Ha’Mavet to do that thing, and all the cattle of Egypt died; but none of the cattle of Israel did die, yea not even one from among them.

6. And Pharaoh sent his servants out among the Hebrews to report; and behold! They saw that there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead.

7. And Pharaoh was angered, the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

chapter-aka: The Plague of Boils

1. And it came to pass that after the death of the cattle of Egypt, and Pharaoh would not let the people of Israel go, that Moses did cry again unto YHVH{a}.
[a] See YHVH

2. YHVH said unto Moses and unto Aaron: Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace;

3. And Aaron shall speak unto Pharaoh, saying: Thus saith YHVH: Let my people go, that they may serve me;

4. And because thou has broken thy word, and thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I send boils upon the people of Egypt, that they shall know that YHVH, Elohim{a} of the Hebrews, is Lord{b} over all.
[a] See Elohim
[b] See Adonai

5. And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of Egypt.

6. And then, let Moses sprinkle the ashes toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

7. ¶ And it came to pass that they took ashes of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh;

8. And Aaron spoke unto Pharaoh, saying: Thus saith YHVH: Let my people go, that they may serve me!

9. And YHVH sayeth further: Because thou has broken thy word, and thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I send boils upon the people of Egypt,

10. And now thy people shall know that YHVH, Elohim of the Hebrews, is Lord over all.

11. And Moses sprinkled the ashes up toward heaven; and it became a boil, breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.

12. ¶ And it came to pass that Pharaoh sent for his sorcerers{a}, and his magicians{b}, and commanded that they show unto the Hebrews the strength of Pharaoh, for Israel knew not the blains except to see that Egypt suffered.
[a] Hebrew, "kashaph;" those that practice magick or priestcraft; see Doctrines of the Saints 106:1-35, Priestcraft
[b] Hebrew: "chartom;" an "engraver" or "writer," likely of spells; see Priestcraft; Doctrines of the Saints 106:1-35

13. But the sorcerers, and magicians, these could not cursed Israel, nor could they remove their cursing that YHVH had dealt them through Moses, the prophet{a} of YHVH;
[a] See Prophet

14. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.

15. And Pharaoh hardened his heart, and he hearkened not unto them, even as YHVH had spoken unto Moses.

chapter-aka: The Plague of Thunderings and Hail

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} said unto Moses: Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him: Thus saith YHVH, Elohim{b} of the Hebrews: Let my people go, that they may serve me!
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

2. For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.

3. For now I will stretch out my hand{a}, that I may smite thee and thy people with a plague; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
[a] Hebrew, "yaman;" an expression of close friendship of God, maybe a reference to Moses, see 4 Moses 36:8

4. And in very deed, for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth;

5. Therefore, speak unto Pharaoh the thing which I have command thee, who as yet exalteth himself that he will not let them go.

6. And behold, tomorrow about this time, I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof, even until now.

7. Send, therefore, now and gather thy herds{a} and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man, woman, and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them; and they shall die.
[a] Or "cattle"

8. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses spoke unto Pharaoh, even all that he was told to say, and the Word of YHVH{a} was heard through Aaron, the mouthpiece{b} of Moses;
[a] See Word of YHVH
[b] Or "prophet"

9. And that they that feared the Word of YHVH among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses, and they that regarded not the Word of YHVH left his servants and his cattle in the field.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses: Stretch forth thine hand toward heavens, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and woman, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of Egypt.

11. And Moses stretched forth his rod{a} toward heaven; and YHVH sent thunder and hail, and the fire{b} ran along upon the ground; and YHVH rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
[a] See Rod
[b] May refer to lightning; the wrath of God against Egypt

12. And so there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

13. And the hail smote Egypt throughout all the land; all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field and brake every tree of the field.

14. And it came to pass that only in the land of Goshen, where Israel did dwell, was there no hail.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron and said unto them: I have sinned this time; YHVH is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.

16. Entreat your Elohim, even YHVH, that it is enough, that there will be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.

17. And Moses said unto him: As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto YHVH; and the thunder shall cease; neither shall there be anymore hail, that thou mayest know how that the belongeth to YHVH.

18. But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear YHVH Elohim{a}.
[a] See YHVH Elohim

19. And when Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto YHVH; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.

20. And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, and the hail, and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

21. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened; neither would he let Israel go, even as YHVH had spoken by His mouthpiece, Moses.

chapter-aka: The Plague of Locusts

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} said unto Moses: Go in unto Pharaoh; for he hath hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants; therefore, I will show these my signs before him—
[a] See YHVH

2. And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt and my signs which I have done among them, that ye may know how that I am YHVH.

3. And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh and said unto him: Thus saith YHVH, Elohim{a} of the Hebrews: How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me?
[a] See Elohim

4. Let my people go, that they may serve me!

5. Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow will I bring the locusts{a} into thy coast;
[a] Hebrew, "arbeh;" a type of insect that eats crops

6. And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field;

7. And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.

8. And Moses turned himself and went out from Pharaoh.

9. ¶ Now the flax and the barley had been smitten by the mighty storms of YHVH; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled;

10. Yet the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they were not grown up.

11. And the servants said unto Pharaoh: How long shall this man be a snare unto us? Let the men go, that they may serve YHVH, their Elohim; knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

12. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh.

13. And Pharaoh said unto them: Go; serve YHVH, your Elohim; but who are they that shall go?

14. And Moses said: We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto YHVH.

15. And Pharaoh said unto them: Let YHVH be so with you as I will let you go, and your little ones; look to it, for evil is before you.

16. Not so; go now, ye that are men, and serve YHVH; for that ye did desire.

17. And Moses and Aaron were driven out from the presence of Pharaoh.

18. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses: Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.

19. And Moses stretched forth his rod{a} over the land of Egypt; and YHVH brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
[a] See Rod

20. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested in all the coasts of Egypt; very grievous were they.

21. Before them there were no such locusts as they; neither after them shall be such, for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened;

22. And they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of Egypt.

23. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said: I have sinned against YHVH, your Elohim, and against you;

24. Now, therefore, forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat YHVH, your Elohim, that He may take away from me this death only.

25. And Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated YHVH.

26. And YHVH turned a mighty strong West wind, which took away the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

27. But Pharaoh hardened his heart so that he would not let Israel go.

1. And it came to pass that Moses cried out again unto YHVH{a}, asking for pity that Israel might be made free.
[a] See YHVH

2. And YHVH said unto Moses: Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.

3. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.

4. They saw not one another; neither rose any from his place for three days; but all of Israel had light in their dwellings.

5. ¶ And it came to pass that Pharaoh called unto Moses and said: Go ye; serve YHVH; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed; let your little ones also go with you.

6. And Moses said: Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto YHVH, our Elohim{a}.
[a] See Elohim

7. Our herds also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind, for thereof must we take to serve YHVH, our Elohim; and we know not with what we must serve YHVH until we come thither.

8. But Pharaoh hardened{a} his heart, and he would not let them go.
[a] The real plague is the hardened heart egoism, pride and self-centeredness

9. And Pharaoh said unto him: Get thee from me; take heed to thyself; see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

10. And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} came unto Moses, saying: Thou, Moses, and thy brother Aaron did all these wonders{b} before Pharaoh;
[a] See YHVH
[b] Or "miracles"

2. And when ye went out from Pharaoh he was in great anger and would not repent, and Pharaoh hardened his heart so that he would not let my children, Israel, go out of his land.

3. Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; therefore, my wonders shall be multiplied in the land of Egypt:

4. Yea, and I will bring one plague more upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; and behold, afterwards he will let you go hence; when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether;

5. Therefore, speak now in the ears of the people: Thus saith YHVH: About midnight{a} will I send Mal’akh Ha’Mavet{b} out into the midst of Egypt; and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die,
[a] Or "in the middle of the night"
[b] Hebrew, "angel of death;" see Mal’akh Ha’Mavet

6. Yea, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill, and all the firstborn of beasts; they shall die.

7. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

8. But against any of my children, Israel, shall not a dog wag its tongue against man, woman, or beast; and this that ye may know how that YHVH doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

9. And all these, the servants of Pharaoh, shall come down unto me and bow themselves down unto me, saying: Get thee out and all the people that follow thee.

10. And then, let every man borrow of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver and jewels of gold, and I will grant Israel favor in the sight of the Egyptians.

11. And after that I will lead my children out of Israel.

12. ¶ And it came to pass that all that loved YHVH in Israel did hearken unto the Passover, even has Moses had shown{a} them.

1. And it came to pass that at midnight{a} YHVH{b} send Mal’akh Ha’Mavet{c} and he smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.
[a] Or "in the middle of the night"
[b] See YHVH
[c] See Mal’akh Ha’Mavet

2. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

3. And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron by night and said: Rise up and get you forth from among my people, both ye and all of Israel; and go; serve YHVH as ye have said;

4. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.

5. And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said: We have found our firstborn all dead; therefore, get ye out of the land, lest we die also.

6. And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

7. And all of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they did take unto themselves of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment;

8. And YHVH did give the people favor{a} in the sight of the Egyptians so that they did give unto them such things as they required;
[a] In the Hebrew, "favor," but in the Egyptian, "fear"

9. And thus did Israel plunder the Egyptians, even as YHVH has spoken{a}.
[a] See 3 Moses 3:31-32

10. Moreover, the man{a} Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.
[a] Hebrew, "Adam"

11. And the Israelites baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt (for it was not leavened) because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry; neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals{a}.
[a] Food and provisions

12. And it came to pass the selfsame day that YHVH did bring the His children, Israel, out of the land of Egypt:

13. And Moses did take the bones of Joseph with him; for Joseph had straightly sworn{a} the children of Jacob, saying: Elohim will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
[a] See 2 Moses 35:44

14. ¶ And it came to pass that they took their journey from Egypt into the wilderness{a}, the land of Mormon{a};
[a] "A wild or untamed place;" "wilderness;" see Mormon

15. And YHVH went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud{a}, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light—to go by day and night.
[a] This may have been an angel hidden in a cloud who's power became visible in the darkness

16. And YHVH took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people.

chapter-aka: The Remembrance

1. And it came to pass that all of Israel journeyed out from Egypt, and they were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.

2. And a mixed multitude went up also with them, and flocks, and possessions, even their numerous herds.

3. Now the sojourning of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

4. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of YHVH{a} went out from the land of Egypt.
[a] See YHVH 

5. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah said unto the people: Remember this day in which ye came out from Egypt, from out of the house of bondage;

6. For by strength of the hand YHVH were you brought out from that place; there shall no leavened bread be eaten;

7. And it shall be that when YHVH shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which He sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.

8. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to YHVH.

9. Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee; neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.

10. And thou shalt show thy son and thy daughters in that day, saying: This is done because of that which YHVH did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

11. And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the Torah{a} of YHVH may be in thy mouth; for with a strong hand hath YHVH brought thee out of Egypt.
[a] Hebrew, "Law." "Instructions," or "Teachings"

12. Thou shalt, therefore, keep this ordinance in his season from year to year for all time.

13. ¶ And it shall come to pass that when YHVH shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as He sware unto thee and thy fathers amd thy mothers, and shall give it thee,

14. That thou shalt set apart unto YHVH every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast belong to YHVH.

15. And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck; and all the firstborn of mankind among thy children shalt thou redeem;

16. For thus sayeth YHVH: Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among Israel, both of mankind and of beast; it is mine.

17. And it shall be when thy son or thy daughter should ask thee in time to come, saying: What is this?

18. That thou shalt say unto them: By strength of hand YHVH brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.

19. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that YHVH slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of mankind and the firstborn of beast;

20. Therefore, I sacrifice to YHVH all the firstborn of my children, that I redeem.

21. And it shall be for a token{a} upon thine hand, and for frontlets{b} between thine eyes; for by strength of hand YHVH brought us forth out of Egypt.
[a] Here Moses is speaking metaphorically; the work "token" may also be translated as "banner," just as with frotlets Moses wants them to remember in their deeds and actions; see Signs and tokens
[b] Here Moses is speaking metaphorically; a frontlet is an ornamental cloth that hanging over the upper part of an altar, or a decorative band or ornament worn on the forehead; we are the altar of God, the temples of God; see 1 Corinthians 3:16

22. ¶ And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that Ha’Elohim{a} led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near;
[a] See Ha'Elohim

23. For Ha’Elohim said: Lest peradventure the people retreat when they see war and they return to Egypt;

24. But Elohim led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Sea; and Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

chapter-aka: Dividing the Waters from the Waters

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} spake unto Moses and Zipporah, saying: Speak unto my children, Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon; ye shall encamp by the sea before it;
[a] See YHVH

2. For Pharaoh will say of Israel: They are entangled in the land; the wilderness hath shut them in.

3. And Pharaoh will harden his heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be fierce upon Pharaoh and upon all his host, that the Egyptians may know that I am YHVH.

4. And Israel did even as they were told.

5. ¶ And it came to pass that the king of Egypt was told that the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people;

6. And the Egyptians said: Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?

7. And Pharaoh hardened his heart, and he made ready his chariot and took his army with him;

8. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

9. And Pharaoh pursued after Israel; and Israel went out with a high hand{a}.
[a] Arrogance; falsely assuming they have the power to destroy Israel

10. But the Egyptians pursued after them—all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army—and overtook them encamping by the sea.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that when Pharaoh drew nigh, Israel lifted up their eyes; and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid; and Israel cried out unto YHVH.

12. And they said unto Moses and Zipporah: Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

13. Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying: Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.

14. And Zipporah said unto the people, Fear ye not! Stand still and see the salvation of YHVH, which he will show to you today;

15. The Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever, for YHVH shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

16. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses and Zipporah: Wherefore criest thou unto me? Speak unto my children, Israel, that they go forward;

17. But lift thou, Moses, up thy rod{a}, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it; and Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
[a] See 3 Moses 4:2-17,28; Exodus 2-9, 17; Rod

18. And I say unto thee: The hearts of the Egyptians shall be hardened, and they shall follow them; and I will weigh heavily upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his army, and upon his horsemen.

19. And the Egyptians shall know that I am YHVH when I have laid my burdens upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{a}, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them;
[a] See Angel of YHVH

21. And the pillar of the cloud came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to the Egyptians:

22. But the pillar of the cloud gave unto the Israelites light by night so that the one came not near the other all the night.

23. And Moses stretched out the rod in his hand over the sea; and YHVH caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land; and the waters were divided.

24. And Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left.

25. And the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

26. ¶ And it came to pass that in the morning, YHVH looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and was against the host of the Egyptians, and took off their chariot wheels,

27. And behold, as the wheels of their chariots spun out of control the Egyptians said: Let us flee from the face of Israel; for YHVH fighteth for them against us.

28. And YHVH said unto Moses: Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, and upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

29. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea did return to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and YHVH overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

30. And the waters returned and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

31. But Israel walked upon dry land{a} in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left.
[a] Or "the ground"

32. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH saved Israel out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.

33. And Israel saw that great work which YHVH did upon the Egyptians; and the people feared YHVH and believed YHVH and His servants, Moses and Zipporah.

1. Then sang Miriam, the sister of Moses, and the daughters of Israel, this song unto YHVH{a} and spake, saying:
[a] See YHVH

2. ¶ I will sing unto YHVH for He hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

3. YHVH is my strength and my song, and is become my salvation; He is my God{a}, and I will prepare Him a habitation, Elohim{b} of my father and my mothers, and I will exalt Him.
[a] Hebrew, "El;" "God" or "strength;" See El
[b] See Elohim

4. YHVH is a Man of war; YHVH is His name.

5. The chariots and the host of Pharaoh hath He cast into the sea; his chosen captains also are drowned in the Sea.

6. The depths have covered them; they sank into the bottom as a stone.

7. Thy right hand{a}, O YHVH, is become glorious in power; thy right hand, O YHVH, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
[a] Hebrew feminine noun; in Kabbalah the right hand is Mercy, representing Jesus Christ

8. And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee; thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.

9. And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.

10. The enemy said: I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.

11. Thou didst blow with thy wind; the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty waters.

12. Who is like unto thee, O YHVH, among the gods{a}? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
[a] Hebrew, "ha’elim." El is the masculine form of "god" and "im" is masculine plural

13. Thou stretchedst out thy right hand; the earth swallowed them.

14. Thou, in thy mercy, hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed; thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

15. The people shall hear and be afraid; sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.

16. Then the dukes{a} of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling, shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away, and fear and dread shall fall upon them.
[a] Or "chiefs," or "commanders;" a notable group of military leaders

17. Yea, the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone until Your people pass by, O YHVH, till the people which thou hast purchased pass by.

18. Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O YHVH, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in—in the sanctuary, O YHVH which thy hands have established.

19. YHVH shall reign forever and ever.

20. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and YHVH brought again the waters of the sea upon them;

21. But Thy children, Israel, went on dry land in the midst of the sea.

22. ¶ And the prophetess of YHVH, Miriam, sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

23. And Zipporah led the daughters of Israel in song, and thy sang: Sing ye to YHVH, for He hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

chapter-aka: Manna (What is this?)

1. And it came to pass that in the fifteenth day of the second month{a} after their departing out of the land of Egypt, Moses and Ziphorah brought Israel from the Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur;
[a] The Second month on the Hebrew calendar is Iyar; see Iyar

2. And they went three days in the wilderness and found no water, and pitched their tents in Marah{a};
[a] Hebrew, feminine name; from the Hebrew "marar," which means "bitter"

3. But behold, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore, the name of it was called Marah.

4. And it came to pass that the people murmured against Moses, saying: What shall we drink?

5. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah cried unto YHVH; and YHVH instructed them to take a branch that had fallen from a tree;

6. And when Zipporah cast the rod into the waters, the waters were made sweet, and there Moses and Zipporah gave them a statute{a} and an ordinance{b};
[a] A law or decree; something prescribed, a process that is acting out
[b] Or "an offering;" a sacred ceremony performed by those with priesthood authority

7. And the women were led by Zipporah and Miriam in pouring out libations{a} unto YHVH of the sweet water onto the earth, for such was the abundance of water.
[a] See libations

8. ¶ And there YHVH proved Israel, and the Voice{a} said: If thou wilt diligently hearken to the Voice of YHVH, thy Elohim{b}, and wilt do that which is right in My sight, and wilt give ear to My mitzvah{c}, and keep all My statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians;
[a] See The Voice
[b] See Elohim
[c] Hebrew: "obligation," "tradition," or "commandment"

9. For I am YHVH; I am Ha’Elohim{a} that healeth thee.
[a] See Ha’Elohim

10. And all the congregation of Israel did hear the Voice, and they were afraid and desired to flee that place.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that Israel went on, and they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters;

12. And there in Elim, Israel expressed their marvel, for they did see the Angel of YHVH{a} going before them, and with them as fire in the night;
[a] See Angel of YHVH

13. And they did hear the Voice of YHVH{a} as a thunder from within their hearts;
[a] See Voice of YHVH

14. And they had seen the plagues of the Egyptians, and they feared YHVH, even their Elohim that had delivered them from evil.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Israel took their journey from Elim; and on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt, all the congregation of Israel came unto a place of rest in the wilderness.

16. And there the whole congregation of Israel murmured against Moses and Zipporah, and Aaron and Miriam;

17. And Israel said unto Moses and Aaron: Would we had died by the hand of YHVH in the land of Egypt when we sat by the fleshpots and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

18. Then said YHVH unto Moses and Zipporah: Behold! I will rain food{a} from heaven for you;
[a] Or "provisions"

19. And the people shall go out and gather enough for everyone, according to the number of your persons; take ye everyone for them which are in your tents;

20. And this that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my Torah{a} or no.
[a] Hebrew, "Teachings,"  "Instructions," or "Law"

21. And it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.

22. ¶ And Moses and Aaron said unto all of Israel: This evening, then ye shall know that YHVH hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;

23. And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of YHVH, for He heareth your murmurings against Him; and who are we, that ye murmur against us?

24. And Moses said: This shall be when YHVH shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full, for that YHVH heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against Him.

25. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against YHVH.

26. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses spake unto Aaron: Say unto all of the congregation of Israel: Come near before YHVH; for He hath heard your murmurings.

27. And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of Israel, that they did look out toward the wilderness; and behold, the glory of YHVH appeared in the cloud.

28. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH spake unto Moses and Zipporah, saying: I have heard the murmurings of Israel, my children; now speak unto them, saying:

29. At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am YHVH, your Elohim.

30. And that evening, the quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

31. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoarfrost on the ground.

32. And when Israel saw it, they said one to another: What is it{a}? for they wist not what it was.
[a] See Manna

33. And Moses said unto them: This is the bread which YHVH hath given you to eat.

34. This is the thing which YHVH hath commanded: Gather of it everyone according to their eating.

35. And Israel called the name thereof manna{a}; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
[a] See Manna

chapter-aka: The Sabbath of the Seventh Day

1. And it came to pass that Israel went about to gather manna, some more, some less.

2. And when they did take enough, that they gathered much and had nothing over; and they that gathered little had no lack; they gathered everyone according to their eating{a}.
[a] Or "needs"

3. And Moses said: Let no one leave of it till the morning.

4. Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning; and it bred maggots and stank; and Moses was wroth with them.

5. And they gathered it every morning, everyone according to their eating; and when the sun waxed hot, it melted{a}.
[a] Or "it wasted away," or "it became worthless"

6. ¶ And it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much for one person; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

7. And Moses said unto them: This is that which YHVH hath said: Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath{a} of the Seventh Day unto YHVH;
[a] Hebrew, "rest;" see 4 Moses 2

8. Bake that which ye will bake today, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

9. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not stink; neither was there any maggots therein.

10. And Moses said: Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath unto YHVH; today ye shall not find it in the field.

11. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none.

12. And it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

13. ¶ And YHVH said unto Moses and Zipporah: How long will my children refuse to keep my mitzvah{a} and my Torah{b}?
[a] Hebrew: "tradition," "commandment," or "obligation"
[b] Hebrew, "Teachings," "Instructions," or "Law"

14. Look, for that YHVH hath given you the sabbath; therefore, He giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye everyone in their place; let no one go out of their place on the seventh day.

15. And it came to pass that Zipporah and Miriam went out and gathered the daughters of Israel, and they did grant them the mitzvah of the Sabbath of YHVH; and these daughters took this Torah back and taught their homes:

16. And Israel rested on the seventh day.

17. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses said unto Israel: This is the mitzvah which YHVH hath given: Fill a vessel of the bread of YHVH to be kept for your generations,

18. That they may see the bread wherewith YHVH hath fed you in the wilderness when He brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

19. And Moses said unto Aaron: Take a pot, and fill it full of manna therein, and lay it up before YHVH, to be kept for your generations.

20. And it came to pass that as YHVH commanded Moses, so did Aaron, and he laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

21. And it came to pass that Israel did eat manna until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

chapter-aka: Water from the Rock

1. And it came to pass that in the third month{a} after their departing out of the land of Egypt, all the congregation of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin after their journeys, according to the commandment of YHVH{b}, and pitched in Rephidim; and there was no water for the people to drink.
[a] The third month on the Hebrew calendar is Sivan; see Sivan
[b] See YHVH

2. Wherefore, the people did chide with Moses and Zipporah, and said: Give us water that we may drink.

3. And it came to pass that Moses said unto them: Why chide ye with me? Wherefore do ye tempt YHVH?

4. And Israel thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses and Zipporah, saying: Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt—to kill us, and our children, and our cattle with thirst—thou and thy wife, the foreigner?

5. And Moses cried unto YHVH, saying: What shall I do unto this people? They be almost ready to stone us!

6. And YHVH said unto Moses: Go on before the people and take with thee of the Elders of Israel; and thy rod{a}, take in thine hand and go.
[a] See Rod

7. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.

8. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses did even as he was told in the sight of the Elders of Israel.

9. And Moses called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the chiding of Israel and because they tempted YHVH, saying: Is YHVH among us or not?

10. But Moses did not give the glory to YHVH, and the Elders of Israel did bless Moses, and YHVH was not pleased.

11. But Zipporah, the wife of Moses, did remember YHVH; and she and Miriam did lead the daughters of Israel in offer libations{a} to remember the blessings of YHVH.
[a] See Libations

12. And YHVH was pleased, and blessed the daughters of YHVH for remembering that all good things come from YHVH.

chapter-aka: The Sign of the Covenant

1. And it came to pass that in the third month{a}, after their departing out of the land of Egypt, that the Amaleks worried that Israel should come and destroy them;
[a] See Sivan

2. Therefore, they came forth to do battle with Israel.

3. And Moses saw their armies, and he went to YHVH{a} saying: I could lead the men of Egypt into battle and prevail, but Israel hath no armies.
[a] See YHVH

4. And YHVH spoke unto Moses, saying: gather strong men from each of the tribes and Joshua, son of Nun shall lead them;

5. And thou shall watch them from above, and shall raise up thy hand in my name;

6. And behold, when thy hand is raised in the sign of my covenant, as given to thee and Zipporah by my servant Jethro the Reuel{a}, her father, Israel shall prevail;
[a] Hebrew, "friend of God"

7. But if thy hand should fail thee, the power endowed thee from the covenant shall fail, and Israel should falter.

8. And it came to pass that Moses went and said unto Joshua: Choose us out men from all the tribes of Israel, and go out, fight with Amalek;

9. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of Ha’Elohim{a} in mine hand, and Israel shall prevail.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

10. ¶ And it came to pass that Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, the brother of Moses, and Hur, the son of Miriam, went up to the top of that hill.

11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand in the sign, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

12. And when the hand of Moses grew heavy they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat thereon;

13. And Aaron, and Hur stayed up his hand, the one on the one side and the other on the other side; and his hand was steady until the going down of the sun.

14. ¶ And it came to pass that Joshua overthrew Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

15. And YHVH said unto Moses: Write this for a memorial in the book{a} and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
[a] Likely the or a Book of Testimonies

16. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses built an altar and called the name of it YHVH-nissif;

17. For Moses said: Because a hand was lifted up towards Yah{a}; and behold, YHVH will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
[a] See Yah

18. And Miriam and Zipporah led the daughters of Israel in song and dance, and offered libations before YHVH.

chapter-aka: The Division of Labor

1. And it came to pass in the third month{a} from the time that Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, came they into the wilderness of the Mount of Ha’Elohim{b}.
[a] See Sivan
[b] "The Mount of the Gods or "the Mount of Strength"

2. And it came to pass that in that month, Jethro the Reuel{a}, the High Priest of El Elyon{b}, Moses' father-in-law, having heard of all that Ha’Elohim{c} had done for Moses and for Israel, His people, and that YHVH had brought Israel out of Egypt,
[a] Hebrew, "friend of God;" a name or title for Jethro, a High Priest of El Elyon
[b] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon
[c] Hebrew, "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim

3. Then Jethro, the father of Zipporah, who he did give unto Moses for a wife after he had sent her back to gather Moses from that well{a}, came and visited with his daughter and her two sons.
[a] See 3 Moses 3:38-43

4. ¶ And so it was that Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the Mount of Ha’Elohim;

5. And Jethro sent a messenger unto Moses, saying: I, thy father-in-law, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

6. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did bow unto him, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.

7. And Moses told his father-in-law all that YHVH had done{a} unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for the sake of Israel, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how YHVH delivered them.
[a] See 3 Moses 7-20

8. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which YHVH had done to Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

9. And Jethro said: Blessed be YHVH, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

10. Now I know that YHVH is greater than all the elohim{a}; for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly He was above them.
[a] See Elohim of man 

11. And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for El Elyon; and Aaron came, and all the men of the Elders of Israel, to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses before Ha’Elohim.

12. ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.

13. And when the father-in-law of Moses saw all that he did for the people, he said: What is this thing that thou doest to the people?

14. Why doth thou sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto evening?

15. And Moses said unto his father-in-law: Because the people come unto me to inquire of our Elohim;

16. When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge{a} between one and another, and I do make them know the laws and statutes{b} of Ha’Elohim{c}.
[a] See 4 Moses 43-50
[b] Civil rules for their society
[c] Hebrew, "the gods"

17. And the father-in-law of Moses said unto him: The thing that thou doest is not good;

18. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou and this people that is with thee; for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.

19. Hearken now unto my voice; I will give thee counsel, and El Elyon shall be with thee, and Ha'Elohim shall be with thee.

20. You stand before Ha’Elohim for the people, that thou mayest bring their causes unto Ha’Elohim;

21. And thou shalt teach them decrees and laws{a}, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do:
[a] The laws of their nation

22. Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people able men and women such as reverent men and women of truth, hating dishonest gain;

23. Place such over the people to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and let them judge the people at all seasons;

24. Do this and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge; so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

25. And if thou shalt do this thing, and Elohim command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure; and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.

26. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses did hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.

27. And Moses and Zipporah chose able men and women from out of all of Israel and made them heads over the people, even as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

28. And they judged the people at all seasons; the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

29. And it came to pass that Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

chapter-aka: The People of the Covenant

1. And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah went up unto Ha’Elohim{a}; and YHVH{b} called unto them out of the mountain, saying: Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell my children, Israel:
[a] See Ha'Elohim
[b] See YHVH

2. Ye have seen what I did{a} unto the Egyptians and how I bare you on the wings of eagles and brought you unto myself;
[a] See 3 Moses 8-18

3. Now, therefore, if ye will obey My Voice{a} indeed and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people; for all the earth is mine;
[a] The Holy Spirit; See The Voice

4. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of Priests and Priestesses and a holy nation.

5. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto my children, Israel!

6. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah came, and called for the Elders of the people, both the men and the women, and laid before their faces all these words which YHVH commanded him.

7. And all the people answered together as one and said: All that YHVH hath spoken we will do.

8. And Moses and Zipporah returned the words of the people unto YHVH.

9. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses: Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe thee forever.

10. And Moses and Zipporah told the words of the people unto YHVH.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{a} said unto Moses and Zipporah: Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes,
[a] See Angel of YHVH

12. And be ready against the third day; for the third day will YHVH come down in the sight of all the people upon the Mount.

13. And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying: Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the Mount or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the Mount shall surely die;

14. There shall not a hand touch it, but they shall surely die; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live.

15. And when the shofar soundeth long, then shall they come up to the Mount.

16. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah went down from the Mount unto the people and sanctified the people; and they did wash themselves and their clothes.

17. And Moses and Zipporah said unto the people: Be ready against the third day; until then, be ye untouched{a}.
[a] A commandment not to worship any other gods, they are told to commit no idolatry while waiting on YHVH

18. ¶ And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders, and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the Mount, and the voice of the shofar was exceeding loud, so that all the people in the camp trembled.

19. And Moses and Zipporah brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with Ha’Elohim; and they stood at the depth of the Mount.

20. And all about it was the Mount filled with smoke because YHVH descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole Mount quaked greatly.

21. And when the voice of the shofar sounded long and waxed louder and louder, and Moses spake; and Ha’Elohim answered him by the Voice.

22. And YHVH came down upon the Mount, on the top of the Mount; and the angel of YHVH called Moses and Zipporah up to the top of the Mount; and Moses and Zipporah went up.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH said unto Moses and Zipporah: Go down; charge the people, lest they break through{a} unto YHVH to gaze, and many of them perish.
[a] Come before the Lord before being sanctified/born again; see Hebrews 12:14

24. And let the Priests and Priestesses also, which come near to YHVH, sanctify themselves, lest YHVH break forth{a} upon them.
[a] Or "God will kill them;" see Matthew 11:27, John 1:18, Doctrines of the Saints 61a:13

25. And Zipporah said unto the angel of YHVH: The people of Israel cannot come up to the Mount of Ha’Elohim{a}; for thou charged us, saying: Set bounds about the Mount and sanctify it; therefore thy fear be upon them.
[a] Hebrew, "mountain of the gods," or mountain of strength

26. And the angel of YHVH said unto them: Away, get down; and you shalt come up, both of you and Aaron with you;

27. But let not the Priests and the Priestesses, and the people break through to come up unto YHVH, lest He break forth upon them.

28. So Moses and Zipporah went down unto the people and spoke unto them.

4. ¶ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven{a} image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
[a] Or "carved"

5. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them;

6. For I, YHVH, thy Elohim, am a jealous{a} God{b}, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
[a] Passionate; moved to take action; fiercely protective

[a] Hebrew: "obligation," "commandment," or "tradition"

8. ¶ Thou shalt not take upon yourselves my name, the name{a} of YHVH, thy Elohim, in vain{b}; for YHVH will not hold them guiltless that taketh my name in vain, mocking the Covenant.

[b] A way of saying "false believer" or "hypocrite;" see Mark 7:6-9

11. In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;

12. For in six days YHVH made{a} heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore, YHVH blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
[a] Hebrew, "asah;" "do," "create," "work," or "perfect"

chapter-aka: The Book of the Testimony

1. And it came to pass that all the people of Israel saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the shofar, and the mountain smoking;

2. And when the people saw it, they removed and stood afar off, and they said unto Moses and Zipporah: Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not Ha’Elohim{a} speak with us, lest we die.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

3. And Moses said unto the people: Fear not; for Ha’Elohim is come to prove you, and that reverence to YHVH{a} may be before your faces, that ye walk in teshuvah{b}.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Teshuvah

4. And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where Ha’Elohim was.

5. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses and Zipporah: Thus thou shalt say unto my children, Israel: Ye have seen that I have talked with you from the heavens.

6. Ye shall not make unto you elohim{a} of silver; neither shall ye make unto you gods{a} of gold.
[a] Idols; see Elohim of man

7. An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen;

8. And in all places where I record HaShem{a} I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
[a] See HaShem

9. And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it:

10. Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy shame{a} be not discovered thereon.
[a] Or "indecency," "undefended parts," or "nakedness"

11. ¶ And it came to pass that the Voice{a} spake unto Moses and Zipporah, saying: Come up unto YHVH, Moses and Zipporah; and bring with thee Aaron, Miriam, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the Elders of Israel, thirty-five of the males and thirty-five of the females; and worship ye afar off.
[a] The Holy Ghost; see The Voice

12. And Moses and Zipporah, alone shall come near YHVH; but they shall not come nigh; and the people shall not go up with thee.

13. And Moses and Zipporah came and told the people all the words of YHVH and all the charge;

14. And all the people answered with one voice{a} and said: All the words which YHVH hath said will we do.
[a] Or "in complete agreement"

15. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses wrote the Word of YHVH{a}, and he and Zipporah, his wife, rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill even as they were instructed;
[a] The book in which Moses wrote all of his and Zipporah’s revelations and inspired knowledge; see Book of the Testimony

16. And they put around the altar twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

17. And Moses sent young men of Israel, which offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto YHVH;

18. And Zipporah sent young women of Israel to give of the offering that none of the meat was wasted.

19. And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins; and half of the blood he gave unto the young women of Israel, and these poured the libations upon the altar.

20. And Moses took the Book of the Testimony and read in the audience of the people; and they said: All that YHVH hath said will we do and be obedient{a}.
[a] Or "we will listen"

21. And Moses had them take the meat from the altar and gave it unto the young men and the young women of Israel and they went and gave meat unto all of Israel that all should eat.

22. And Moses held up the Book of the Testimony and said unto the people: Behold the blood of the covenant, which YHVH hath made with you concerning all these words.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Aaron and Miriam, and Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the Elders of Israel went up; and they saw the Elohim of Israel;

24. And there was under the feet of Ha’Elohim, as it were, a paved work of a sapphire stone as clear as the heavens themselves;

25. But upon the nobles of Israel, not a hand was laid upon them; thus it was that they saw Ha’Elohim and did eat and drink.

26. And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses and Zipporah: Come up to me into the Mount and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and the Torah{a}, and commandments{b} which I have inscribed, that thou mayest teach them.
[a] Hebrew, "Law," "Instructions," or "Teachings"
[b] Hebrew, Mitzvat; a calling or religious duty

27. And Moses and Zipporah rose up, and they sent Joshua to speak unto the Elders;

28. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah went up into the Mount of Ha’Elohim.

29. And Joshua said unto the Elders: Thus sayeth Moses: Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you;

30. And behold, Aaron and Miriam and Hur are with you; and if anyone hath any concerns, let them come unto them.

31. And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah went up into the Mount, and a cloud covered the Mount.

32. And the glory of YHVH abode upon the Mount of Ha’Elohim, and the cloud covered it six days; and the seventh day YHVH called unto Moses and Zipporah out of the midst of the cloud;

33. And the sight of the glory of YHVH was like devouring fire on the top of the Mount in the eyes of Israel.

34. And Moses and Zipporah went into the midst of the cloud and got them up into the Mount; and Moses and Zipporah were in the Mount forty days and forty nights.

chapter-aka: The Calf of Gold

1. And it came to pass that when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the Mount, some of the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him: Up, make us elohim{a}, which shall go before us;
[a] An idol, see Elohim of man

2. And as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.

3. And Aaron said unto them: Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters and bring them unto me.

4. And the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron.

5. And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf;

6. And the people said: These be our elohim{a}, which brought us up out of the land of Egypt.
[a] See Elohim of man

7. ¶ And it came to pass that when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said: Tomorrow is a feast.

8. And the people rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to worship the calf of gold.

9. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH{a} said unto Moses and Zipporah: Go; get yourselves down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves;
[a] See YHVH

10. Behold, they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them;

11. They have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said: These be our elohim{a} which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
[a] See Elohim of man

12. And YHVH said unto Moses and Zipporah: I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiffnecked people;

13. Now, therefore, let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them and that I may consume them; and I will make of thee a great nation{a}.
[a] Or "I will find you another people."

14. And Moses and Zipporah besought YHVH, their Elohim, and Moses said: O YHVH, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?

15. Wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say: For mischief did YHVH bring them out, to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth?

16. Turn from thy fierce wrath; thy people will return from this evil; therefore, come thou not out against them.

17. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.

18. And YHVH said unto Moses: If they will return from the evil which they have done, I will spare them and turn away my fierce wrath;

19. But behold, thou shalt execute judgment upon all that will not repent of this evil this day;

20. Therefore, see thou do this thing that I have commanded thee, or I will execute all that which I had thought to do unto my people.

21. And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah went down from the Mount, and the two sapphire tables of Testimony were in the hands of Moses; the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.

22. And the tables were the work of Elohim{a}, and the writing was the writing of Elohim, graven upon the tables.
[a] Hebrew, "Gods;" see Elohim

23. ¶ And it came to pass that when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses: There is a noise of war in the camp.

24. And Zipporah said unto him: It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery; neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing that I do hear.

25. And it came to pass that as soon as they came nigh unto the camp, that they saw the calf and the people dancing in their nakedness{a};
[a] Or "in their shame;" these Israelites were breaking the covenant they had just made with God, this translation can be taken literally, many of the Israelites were eating and dancing naked; See 3 Moses 30:33

26. And anger of Moses waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands and broke them beneath the Mount.

27. And Moses took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made Israel drink of it.

28. And Moses said unto Aaron: What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

29. And Aaron said: Let not the anger of my lord wax hot; thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

30. For they said unto me: Make us elohim{a}, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
[a] See Elohim of man

31. And I said unto them: Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off.

32. So they gave it me; then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.

33. ¶ And it came to pass that when Moses saw that the people were naked, then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said: Who is on the side of YHVH? Let him come unto me.

34. And it came to pass that all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

35. And Moses said unto them: Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.

36. And Zipporah did say unto her husband: Why for didst thou beg{a} for the lives of Israel, and this to come here and slay them thyself?
[a] See 3Moses 30:14-17

37. And Moses repented and called off the men, but the children of Levi had already done according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

38. ¶ And it came to pass that after this, Moses did say: Consecrate yourselves today to YHVH, even everyone upon their child and upon their brother and their sister, that YHVH may bestow upon you a blessing this day.

39. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people: Ye have sinned a great sin; and now we will go up unto YHVH; peradventure we shall make an atonement{a} for your sin.
[a] See Atonement

40. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah returned unto YHVH and Moses spoke unto YHVH, saying: O, this people have sinned a great sin and have made them idols of gold;

41. Yet now, if thou wilt, forgive their sin{a}; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
[a] Or "transgression;" see Sin

42. And YHVH said unto Moses: Whosoever hath sinned against me, they will I blot out of my book;

43. Therefore, now go, thou and thy wife, Zipporah; lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee;

44. Behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.

chapter-aka: The Face of YHVH

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} said unto Moses and Zipporah: Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, the land which I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it;
[a] See YHVH

2. And I will send my angel{a} before thee, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite;
[a] See Angel of YHVH

3. Unto a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee in the way.

4. And ye shall say unto my children, Israel: Ye are a stiff-necked people; I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee; therefore, now put off thy ornaments{a} from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
[a] Or "trappings;" the things of this world

5. ¶ And it came to pass that when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no one did put on them their ornaments; and so it was that Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the Mount.

6. And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the Congregation{a}.
[a] Or "the Tent of Meeting;" the portable sanctuary in which Israel housed the Ark of the Covenant during their years in the desert, where Moses and Zipporah would meet with YHVH

7. And it came to pass that everyone which sought YHVH went out unto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, which was without the camp.

8. And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tabernacle{a}, that all the people rose up, and stood everyone at their tent door, and looked after Moses until he was gone into the Tabernacle.
[a] Tabernacle of the Congregation

9. And it came to pass that as Moses entered the Tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle; and there YHVH talked with Moses.

10. And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door; and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone in their tent door.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH spoke unto Moses face to face{a}, as a man speaketh unto his friend.
[a] This is a pun or sorts, as this is another way of saying "the Glory of God was upon (him/her)"

12. And Moses turned again into the camp; but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tabernacle.

13. And Moses said unto YHVH: See, thou sayest unto me, and unto Zipporah my wife: Bring up this people{a}; and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me;
[a] 4 Moses 36:1-4

14. Yet thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight;

15. Now, therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight; and consider that this nation is thy people.

16. And the Voice{a} said: My Presence{b} shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
[a] See The Voice
[b] See Shekinah

17. And Moses said: If thy Presence go not with me, carry us not up hence;

18. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us?

19. So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?

20. And YHVH said unto Moses: I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.

21. And Moses said: I beseech thee, show me thy Glory.

22. And the Voice said: I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of YHVH before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.

23. Thou canst not see my face{a} at this time, lest mine anger be kindled against thee also and I destroy thee and thy people:
[a] Here literally, the face of God

24. For there shall no one among them see me at this time and live, for they are exceedingly sinful,

25. And no sinful man or woman hath at any time, neither shall there be any sinful man or woman at any time, that shall see my Face and live.

26. ¶ And YHVH said: Behold, thou shalt stand upon a rock, and I will prepare a place by me for thee.

27. And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of a rock and cover thee with my hand while I pass by.

28. And I will take away mine hand; and thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be seen, as at other times; for I am angry with my people, Israel.

chapter-aka: The Second Stone Tablets

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} said unto Moses: Hew thee two other tables of sapphire like unto the first{b}, and I will write upon them also the words of the Torah{c}, according as they were written at the first on the tables which thou brakest:
[a] See 3 Moses 30:22
[b] See YHVH
[c] Hebrew, "Law," "Instructions," or "Teachings"

2. But they shall not receive according to the first, for I will take away my power from out of their midst;

3. Therefore, my holy order and the ordinances{a} thereof shall not go before them; for my Presence{b} shall not go up in their midst, lest I destroy them.
[a] A law or decree; something prescribed, a process that is acting out
[b] See Shekinah

4. And this is the plague I shall send upon the people because they worshiped the calf which Aaron made:

5. I will give unto them the Torah as at the first, but they shall not understand it, but shall read it to be after the Law of Carnal Commandments{a},
[a] The Law Moses and Zipporah gave Israel the same Torah and the same Priesthood as the first, but because of unrighteousness, without being in the Presence of God they could not see the spiritual side of the Torah and only saw it was an earthly law; see 3 Moses 34:13

6. And I have sworn in my wrath that they shall not enter into my Presence, into my rest, in the days of their pilgrimage;

7. But should they turn away from Egypt{a} and walk in teshuvah{b} to me, then shall they enter Eden{c}, and there find my rest, and enter into my Presence:
[a] Egypt here is representing the things of this world that we must leave behind to be with God
[b] Hebrew, "return;" Jesus Christ is the way back to God, usually translated as "repentance," "redemption," or "grace."
[c] A name for the Divine Feminine, the Creation, and the Earth

8. And in this, their pilgrimage, shall they be my children, even Israel;

9. Therefore, do as I have asked of thee; and be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto the Mount of Ha’Elohim, thou and thy wife, Zipporah, and present thyself there to me in the top of the Mount.

10. And no one else shall come up with thee; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the Mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that Mount; but thy wife, Zipporah, she shall thou bring{a} with thee.
[a] The Lord sees men and women as equals, not one above the other 

11. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and he rose up early in the morning, and went up unto the Mount with his wife, Zipporah, even as YHVH had commanded{a} him, and they took with them the two tables of sapphire.
[a] Or "instructed"

12. And YHVH descended in the cloud, and stood with them there, and that angel of YHVH{a} proclaimed the name of YHVH.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

13. And the angel of YHVH passed by before them{a} and proclaimed{b}: YHVH, YHVH El{c}, is merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,

[b] See Thirteen Attributes of Mercy
[c] Hebrew, "god" (singular) or "might," "strength," or "power"

1. And Moses said: If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord{a}, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among{b} us!

4. And all the people among which thou art shall see the work of YHVH; for it is a terrible{a} thing that I will do with thee.

subchapter: ONE

6. ¶ I am YHVH, thy Elohim{a}, thou shall have no other elohim{b} before me:
[a] See Elohim
[b] Hebrew, "gods;" this can refer to lesser deity or idols; see Elohim and Elohim of man

7. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee;

8. But ye shall tear down their altars, break their obelisks, and cut down their idols of wood, for thou shalt worship no other god; for YHVH, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous Elohim.

9. Do this, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and my people should go a whoring{a} after their elohim and do sacrifice unto their elohim, and one call thee, and thou eat of their sacrifice, and thou fulfill their desire to receive unto thy will to bestow;
[a] To lust after or love another (lesser) god, rejecting the covenant between Israel and YHVH, which is a marriage covenant making Israel literally the people of YHVH

10. Which is to say, when they go a whoring after their elohim, ye too should go a whoring after their elohim, thereby giving pleasure to their flesh.

11. ¶ Thou shalt make thee no molten elohim{a}.

[a] The week of Passover; see 4 Moses 1 and 9:1-16, 5 Moses 14:1-8, Exodus 12:1-28

13. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the first month{a}; for in the first month thou camest out from Egypt.
[a] See Abib

subchapter: FOUR

14. ¶ All of the first born{a} from every womb are mine; even the firstling among thy livestock, be they ox or sheep.
[a] Taken as a carnal commandment this is understood as literally the first born, in Kabbalah this would be one’s first desire; see Desires

15. But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou redeem them not, then shalt thou break their neck:

16. All the firstborn of thy sons and thy daughters thou shalt redeem, and none shall appear before me empty handed.

subchapter: FIVE

17. ¶ Honor the Sabbath of the Seventh day{a}: six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
[a] See 4 Moses 2 and 8, Exodus 16:29-30

subchapter: SIX

18. ¶ And thou shalt observe the Sabbaths of the Feast of Weeks{a}, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the end of the season.
[a] This time is known to Christians as Pentecost; see 4 Moses 9:17-20, Sabbath of Yom HaBikkurim

subchapter: SEVEN

19. ¶ Thrice in the year{a} in thy Sabbaths shall all your children appear before the Lord{a} YHVH, the Elohim of Israel.
[a] Three times in a year Israel is to gather before God: the Passover, Yom HaBikkurim, and Sukkot; these are public celebrations, festivals, a family reunion

20. For I will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders; neither shall anyone desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before YHVH, thy Elohim, thrice in the year.

subchapter: EIGHT

21. ¶ Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Feast of Unleavened Bread{a} be left unto the morning.
[a] See Passover

subchapter: NINE

22. ¶ The first of the firstfruits{a} of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of YHVH, thy Elohim.
[a] See Desires

subchapter: TEN

23. ¶ Thou shalt not cook a kid in the milk of his mother{a}.
[a] Not cooking a kid (baby goat) in its mother's milk is both a statement against the cruelty towards animals, and avoiding the false traditions of Israel’s neighbors; boiling a kid in its mother’s milk was part of an ancient magical practice/ritual; see priestcraft

24. ¶ And YHVH said unto Moses: Write thou these words; for after the tenor{a} of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel;
[a] Or "in accordance with these words"

25. But they shall not understand my words, and the time will come that they should forget them;

26. But when these words are returned unto my children, they shall be given the power to understand the true Priesthood{a} of my covenant with my children, even Israel{a}.
[a] See Doctrines of the Saints 2g:20-26

27. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah were there with YHVH forty days and forty nights{a}; and while in the presence{b} of YHVH they did neither eat bread nor drink water.
[a] Or "a long time." In the Egyptian this is merely the symbol like a gecko
[b] A play on words, they were both with God and the Shekinah was there; see Shekinah

28. And Moses wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, and the ten commandments.

chapter-aka: The Veils

1. And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah came down from the Mount of Ha’Elohim with the two Tables of Testimony in the hands of Moses;

2. And when they came down from the Mount, Moses and Zipporah did not see that the skin of their faces shone after they did talked with YHVH{a}, they being in the Presence{b}.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Shekinah

3. And it came to pass that when Aaron and Miriam and all of Israel saw Moses and Zipporah; behold, the skin of their faces shone{a}; and they were afraid to come nigh them.
[a] Hebrew, "qaran," meaning "to send out rays;" Moses and Zipporah had been transfigured, their faces reflected the light of God, as they had been in the presence of YHVH; see Matthew 17:2

4. And Zipporah called unto them; and Aaron and Miriam and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto them; and Moses and Zipporah talked with them.

5. ¶ And it came to pass that afterwards all of Israel came nigh; and Aaron and Miriam gave Israel in Mitzvoth{a} all that YHVH had spoken with Moses and Zipporah in the Mount of Ha’Elohim.
[a] Hebew, "obligation," "tradition," or "commandment."

6. And Moses and Zipporah did keep the veils{a} on their faces until Aaron and Miriam were done speaking unto Israel;
[a] In Exodus 34 the word translated to "veils" is masveh, from the root "suth," meaning "vesture;" "clothing;" the Hebrew word that appeared above the Egyptian was the Hebrew feminine noun, "salmah," meaning "cloak," or "robe," This may imply that Moses and Zipporah made for themselves cloaks of righteousness, as described in 4 Moses 32:41-59

7. But when Moses and Zipporah went in the Tabernacle before YHVH to speak with Him, they took the veils off until they came out.

8. And when they came out they did speak unto Aaron and Miriam, teaching them that which they should say unto Israel, even that which they were commanded;

9. For when Israel saw the faces of Moses and Zipporah, that the skin of their faces shone, they were sore afraid;

10. And so it was that Moses and Zipporah put the veils upon their face again until they went in to speak with YHVH, for Israel could not stand it.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that because there were those that would not hearken unto Aaron and Miriam, that Moses and Zipporah gathered all the congregation of Israel together;

12. And they spoke unto them, saying: These are the words which YHVH hath instructed, that ye should do them:

13. And Moses and Zipporah rehearsed all that which YHVH had told them unto Israel, but the people understood it not, and thus it was given unto them as the Law of Carnal Commandments{a}.

chapter-aka: The Tabernacle

1. And it came to pass that Moses spake unto all the congregation of Israel, saying: This is the thing which YHVH{a} commanded, saying: Take ye from among you an offering unto YHVH;
[a] See YHVH

2. Whosoever is of a willing heart, let them bring it, an offering to YHVH of gold, and silver, and brass, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

3. And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil and for the sweet incense, and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.

4. And everyone that is wise-hearted{a} among you shall come and make all that YHVH hath instructed: The tabernacle, a tent, and covering, with taches{b}, and boards, bars, pillars, and sockets,
[a] Or, "Skilled men"
[b] Hooks or claps

5. The ark{a}, and the staves thereof with the mercy seat, and the veil of the covering, the table, and staves, and all the vessels, and the showbread,
[a] Hebrew aron, "coffin" or "chest"

6. The candlestick also for the light, and the furniture, and lamps, with the oil for the light,

7. And the incense altar, and the staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle;

8. The altar of burnt offering with a brazen grate, staves, and all the vessels, the laver{a}, and its stand;
[a] A large basin used for ceremonial washings and other temple worship.

9. The hangings of the court, the pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court, the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords;

10. The clothes of service, to do service in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron, the Priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the office of the Priest;

11. The clothes of service, to do service in the Altar of the Orchards, the holy garments for Miriam, the Priestess, and the garments of her daughters, to minister in the office of the Priestess.

12. And all the congregation of Israel departed from the presence of Moses and Zipporah.

13. ¶ And it came to pass that they came, everyone whose heart stirred them up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing;

14. And they brought the offerings to YHVH to the work of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and for all His service, and for the holy garments.

15. And they came, both men and women, as many as that had hearts that move them, and they brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, even all jewels of gold; and everyone that offered, offered an offering of gold unto YHVH.

16. And everyone, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

17. Everyone that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought an offering for YHVH; and everyone, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

18. And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen; and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.

19. And the rulers brought onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate; and spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

20. The congregation of Israel brought a willing offering unto YHVH; every man and every woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which YHVH had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.

chapter-aka: The Master Mason

1. And it came to pass that Moses said unto Israel: See, YHVH{a} hath called by name Bezaleel{b}, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
[a] See YHVH
[b] Hebrew, "in the shadow of God," or "in the protection of God"

2. And YHVH hath filled him with the Breath of Elohim{a}, in knowledge and in wisdom, giving him understanding in all manner of workmanship,
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

3. To devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning works.

4. And YHVH hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

5. These hath YHVH filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, of the embroiderer and of the cunning workman;

6. In blue{a}, and in purple{b}, in scarlet{c}, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work and of those that devise cunning work.
[a] The color of holiness and divinity
[b] The symbol of power, and of glory, used to designate royal dignities; represents purification from sin, wealth and luxury
[c] Seen as both a symbol of royalty and of indulgence; see Scarlet

7. And thus was it said that Bezaleel knew the means by which to join the heavens and the earth, for the malakim{a} had shown unto him how all things were created and thus he was skilled in the craft{d}.
[a] See Malak

8. ¶ And it came to pass that Bezaleel called upon Aholiab, and they upon every wisehearted{a} man, in whom YHVH put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that YHVH had instructed;
[a] ??

9. And they received of Moses all the offering which Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that the people brought yet more free offerings continually, day after day, morning after morning.

11. And all the wise men{a} that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came, everyone from their work which they made;
[a] Or "Skilled men"

12. And they spake unto Moses, saying: The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which YHVH instructed to make!

13. And Moses sent out a commandment{a}, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying: Let neither man nor woman make anymore work for the offering of the sanctuary.
[a] Teaching or instruction

14. And it came to pass that the people were restrained from bringing; for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that every wise-hearted person among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet; with cherubim{a} of cunning work made they them; the curtains were all of one size.
[a] See Cherubim

16. And they coupled the five curtains one unto another; and the other five curtains they coupled one unto another.

17. And they made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the woven edge in the coupling; likewise, they made in the uttermost side of another curtain in the coupling of the second.

18. Fifty loops made they in one curtain, and fifty loops made they in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second; the loops held one curtain to another.

19. And they made fifty taches{a} of gold and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches, so it became one tabernacle.
[a] Hooks or claps

20. And they made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains they made them.

21. And they made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made they upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.

22. And they made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.

23. And they made a covering for the tent of the skins of rams dyed red and a covering of the skins of badgers above that.

24. And they made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up; one board had two tenons equally distant one from another; thus did they make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

25. And they made boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward; and forty sockets of silver they made under the twenty boards—two sockets under one board for his two tenons and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

26. And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, they made twenty boards, and their forty sockets of silver—two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.

27. And for the sides of the tabernacle westward they made six boards; and two boards made they for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.

28. And they were coupled beneath and coupled together at the head thereof to one ring; thus they did to both of them in both the corners.

29. And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets, and they made bars of shittim wood, five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle.

30. And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle, for the sides westward; and they made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.

31. And they overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

32. And they made a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; with cherubim made they it of cunning work.

33. And they made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold; and they cast for them four sockets of silver.

34. And they made a hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework, and the five pillars of it with their hooks;

35. And they overlaid the tops of the pillars and their fillets with gold; but their five sockets were of brass.

chapter-aka: The Ark of the Covenant  

1. And it came to pass that Bezaleel made the ark{a} of shittim wood; and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without and made a crown of gold to it round about.
[a] Hebrew aron, "coffin" or "chest"

2. And Bezaleel cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it, even two rings upon the one side of it and two rings upon the other side of it.

3. And Bezaleel made staves of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold, and he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark to bear the ark.

4. And Bezaleel made the mercy seat{a} of pure gold; and Bezaleel made two cherubim{b} of gold, beaten out of one{c} piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat:
[a] Hebrew, kaporet; the gold lid placed of the Ark of the Covenant with two cherubim
[b] See Cherubim
[c] Symbolizing the covenant of oneness, two ot more in polygamy become one in the marriage covenant; see 1 Moses 4:36-40, 5 Moses 35, Genensis 2:25, Book of the Law of the Lord 15:1; Deuteronomy 6:4

5. One male cherub on the end on this side, and one female cherub on the other end on that side; out of the mercy seat made he the cherubim on the two ends thereof.

6. And the cherubim spread out their wings{a} on high and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, faces to face{b}, they were intertwined{c} in passion one to another;
[a] The text is unclear if these are literal wings or symbolic for something else, the text implies this is sexual in nature
[b] Or "facing inward"
[c] The male and female cherubim were in a sexual embrace, the Talmud explains this as God loving Israel “... and the Cherubim were shown to them, whose bodies were intertwined with one another, and they would be thus addressed: Look! You are beloved before God as the love between man and woman,” Yoma 54a; "...they saw these drawings of cherubs clinging to one another... they have seen her nakedness,” Yoma 54b

7. Even towards the mercy were the faces of the cherubim; their bosoms betwixt one towards another even as two lovers in the marriage{a} covenant;
[a] This fits with the scriptural idea of the covenant between God and Israel as a marriage covenant; see Isaiah 54:5, Jeremiah 3:1-14, Ezekiel 16:8-51

8. And this that the Presence{a} could be felt when any of Israel that were worthy should gaze between the two, male and female,
[a] See Shekinah

9. And that the Voice{a} should be heard by those that are worthy, should Israel gaze betwixt these two.
[a] See The Voice 

10. ¶ And Bezaleel made the table of shittim wood, and he overlaid it with pure gold and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.

11. And also Bezaleel made thereunto a border of a handbreadth round about and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

12. And Bezaleel cast for it four rings of gold and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof; over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.

13. And Bezaleel made the staves of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold to bear the table.

14. And he made the vessels which were upon the table, even the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and the covers to cover withal, of pure gold.

15. ¶ And Bezaleel made the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers were of the same,

16. And six branches going out of the sides thereof—three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof;

17. Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower; so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.

18. And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers; and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.

19. And their knops and their branches were of the same; all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.

20. And Bezaleel made seven lamps, and their snuffers, and snuff dishes of pure gold; of a talent of pure gold made he it and all the vessels thereof.

21. ¶ And Bezaleel made the incense altar of shittim wood; and Bezaleel overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it; also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.

22. And Bezaleel made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.

23. And Bezaleel made the staves of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold.

24. And Bezaleel made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of sweet spices according to the work of the apothecary.

25. ¶ And Bezaleel made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood; and Bezaleel made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same; and he overlaid it with brass.

26. And Bezaleel made all the vessels of the altar, even the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans; all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

27. And Bezaleel made for the altar a brazen grate of network under the four corners thereof, from the base unto the midst of it;

28. And Bezaleel cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves; and he made the staves of shittim wood and overlaid them with brass.

29. And Bezaleel put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.

30. ¶ And Bezaleel made the laver of brass and the foot of it of brass, of the looking glasses of the priestesses assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

31. ¶ And Bezaleel made the court; on the South{a} side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits;
[a] South representing Holy Ghost, God the Spirit; see Cardinal directions

32. And their pillars were twenty and their brazen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

33. And for the North{a} side, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.
[a] North representing Shekinah, God the Mother; see Cardinal directions

36. And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, their pillars were three, and their sockets three; and all the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.

37. And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.

38. And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue{a}, and purple{b}, and scarlet{c}, and fine twined linen.
[a] he color of holiness and divinity
[b] The symbol of power, and of glory, used to designate royal dignities; represents  purification from sin, wealth and luxury
[c] Seen as both a symbol of royalty and of indulgence; see Scarlet

39. And their pillars were four and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their hooks and pillars were of silver, and all the pins of the tabernacle and of the court round about were of brass.

40. ¶ This is the sum of the tabernacle, the even of the Tabernacle of Testimony{a}, as it was counted according to the commandment of Moses for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron, the Priest.
[a] The Tent of the Congregation or Tent of Meeting; See Tabernacle, Exodus 25-31, 35-40

41. ¶ And it came to pass that Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah;

42. And with Bezaleel was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

43. And Bezaleel did make the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

44. And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.

8. ¶ And they made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

9. And it was foursquare; they made the breastplate double; a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.

10. And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was an Odem{a} for the tribe of Reuben, a Pit'dah{b} for the tribe of Simeon, and a Bareket{c} for the tribe of Levi; this was the first row;
[a] Carnelian; see 4 Moses 41:2

19. And they made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the breastplate upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.

20. And they made two other golden rings and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

21. And they did bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

22. ¶ And they made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue; and there was a hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of a habergeon{a}, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.
[a] A strong and thickly woven garment covered with chain mail round the neck and breast

23. And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

24. And they made bells of pure gold and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in, even as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

25. ¶ And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron and for his sons, and a miter{a} of fine linen, and goodly turbans{b} of fine linen, and linen gartels{c} of fine twined linen,
[a] "Headdress" "turben," or "diadem," a priestly turban; the head covering worn by the Priests and Priestesses (eventually just the Priests) of Israel when serving in the Tabernacle
[b] Hebrew. "migbaoth;" a cab, bonnet, or turban; a head covering
[c] Hebrew, "abnet;" a sash or belt

26. And a gartel of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

27. ¶ And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet: HOLINESS TO YHVH.

28. And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the miter, even as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

29. ¶ And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet they also made clothes of service, to do service in the Holy Place, and made the holy garments for Miriam as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

30. And they made for them the mițpaḥath{a} of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
[a] a kind of veil or shawl the reached from the forehead, over the back of the head or to the hips and could fall even lower; like a modern tallit

31. And they did beat gold into thin plates and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen with cunning work.

32. And they made shoulder pieces for the mițpaḥath, which were joined to two of its corners for fastening it.

33. And the curious girdle of her mițpaḥath that was upon it was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen as YHVH commanded Moses and Zipporah;

34. ¶ And they put them on the shoulders of the mițpaḥath for them an urim and thummim{a}, that they should be stones for a memorial to the congregation of Israel, the faith of the daughters of Israel, that needed no sigh when YHVH was ready to lead Israel from Egypt.
[a] Hebrew; "Lights and Perfections" see Urim and Thummim

35. And this was even as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

36. ¶ And they also made the breastpiece of gold, using the work of a skilled craftsman, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.

37. And the breatpicece was of a short span, but wide, and they mounted on it one row of gemstones.

38. And upon the one row was an Odem{a}, a pearl, and a Šoham{b}, even as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.
[a] Carnelian; see 4 Moses 41:2
[b] Onyx; see 4 Moses 41:7

39. ¶ And they made upon the mițpaḥath thin chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold;

40. And they bells upon the hem of the robe; a bell to minister in song, and in dance, and in libations, even as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

41. ¶ And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Miriam and for her daughters, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen dresses of fine twined linen,

42. And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

43. And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet: HOLINESS TO YHVH.

44. And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the heads of Miriam and her daughters, as YHVH commanded Moses and Zipporah.

chapter-aka: Ordination
1. And it came to pass that all the work of the Tabernacle{a} of the Tent of the Congregation was finished; and the congregation of Israel did according to all that YHVH{b} instructed Moses and Zipporah, so did they.
[a] See Tabernacle
[b] See YHVH

2. And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses: the tent, and all the furniture, the taches, the boards, the bars, and the pillars, and the sockets,

3. And the covering of the skins of rams dyed red, and the covering of the skins of the badgers, and the veil of the covering,

4. And the ark of the testimony{a}, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,
[a] See Ark of the Covenant

5. And the table, and all the vessels thereof, and the showbread,

6. And the pure candlestick with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,

7. And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

8. And the brazen altar, and the grate of brass, the staves, and all the vessels, the laver, and the base,

9. And the hangings of the court, the pillars, and the sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, the cords, and the pins, and all the vessels of the service of the Tabernacle for the Tent of the Congregation{a},
[a] Another name for the Tabernacle

10. The clothes of service to do service in the Holy Place{a}, and the holy garments for Aaron, the Priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the office of Priest, and the holy garments for Miriam, the Priestess, and the garments of her daughters, the Priestesses.
[a] the outer chamber of the Tabernacle

11. And all this was according to all that YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah, so that Israel made all the work.

12. And Moses and Zipporah did look upon all the work; and behold, the people had done it even as YHVH had instructed, even so had they done it; and Moses and Zipporah blessed them.

13. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH spake unto Moses, saying: On the first day of the first month{a} shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
[a] See Abib

14. And thou shalt put therein the Ark of the Testimony{a} and cover the Ark with the veil.
[a] See Ark of the Covenant

15. And thou shalt bring in the table and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick and light the lamps thereof.

16. And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

17. And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

18. And thou shalt set the laver{a} between the tent of the congregation and the altar and shalt put water therein.
[a] a large basin in the court of the Tabernacle used for ritual washings

19. And thou shalt set up the court round about and hang up the hanging at the court gate.

20. And thou shalt take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle and all that is therein and shalt hallow it and all the vessels thereof; and it shall be holy.

21. And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all his vessels and sanctify the altar; and it shall be an altar most holy.

22. And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot and sanctify it.

23. And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation and wash them with water;

24. And Zipporah, thy wife, shalt bring Miriam and her daughters to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation and wash them too with water.

25. And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the office of Priest;

26. And Zipporah shall put upon Miriam the holy garments, and anoint her, and sanctify her, that she may minister unto me in the office of Priestess.

27. And thou, Moses, shalt bring the sons of Aaron and clothe them with their robes and garments, and Zipporah shall bring the daughters of Miriam and clothe them in their robes and garments;

28. And thou shalt anoint the sons as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the office of Priest, and Zipporah shall anoint the daughters as she didst anoint their mother;

29. And their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations,

30. But thou shall not anoint them nor shalt thou ordain them as thou and Zipporah, after the order of Enoch; but they that are worthy shall I send to one{a} in that generation that should ordain them.
[a] Implying that there will be people outside of Israel with the High Priesthood, or that those worthy will be ordained by angels, if there are none with the keys to the High Priesthood in Israel.

31. And thus did Moses and Zipporah; according to all that YHVH commanded them, so did they.

32. ¶ And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

33. And Moses reared up the Tabernacle, and fastened the sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up the pillars.

34. And they spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent above upon it, even as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

35. And they took and put the Book of Testimony{a} into the Ark, and set the staves on the Ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the Ark;
[a] See Book of Testimony

36. And they brought the Ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the covering, and covered the Ark of the Book of Testimony, even as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

37. And they put the table in the Tent of the Congregation, upon the side of the Tabernacle Northward, without the veil; and they set the bread in order upon it before YHVH, even as YHVH had commanded Moses and Zipporah.

38. And they put the candlestick in the Tent of the Congregation, over against the table on the side of the tabernacle Southward, and they lighted the lamps before YHVH, even as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

39. And they put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil; and Moses and Zipporah did burn sweet incense thereon, as YHVH instructed them.

40. And they set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle and he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of the Congregation and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

41. And they set the basin between the Tent of the Congregation and the altar and put water there to wash{a} withal.
[a] The washing of the body is a symbol of spiritual cleansing to help one draw closer to God, here dones for those that will perform the duties of reconciliation between Israel and God; see Book of Remembrance 10:1-3, Exodus 30:17-21

42. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Zipporah, and Aaron and his sons, and Miriam and her daughters washed their hands and their feet thereat;

43. When they went into the Tent of the Congregation and when they came near unto the altar, they washed as YHVH instructed Moses and Zipporah.

44. And they reared up the court round about the Tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate.

45. And Moses and Zipporah finished the work.

46. ¶ And it came to pass that a cloud covered the Tent of the Congregation, and the glory of YHVH filled the tabernacle.

47. And Moses and Zipporah were not able to enter into the Tent of the Congregation for the cloud abode thereon, and the Glory of YHVH{a} filled the Tabernacle.
[a] Another term for the Holy Spirit, see Glory of YHVH

48. And when the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle, the congregation of Israel went onward in all their journeys;

49. But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up;

50. For the cloud of YHVH was upon the Tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.

chapter-aka: The Offering of Aaron

1. And it came to pass that on the eighth day of the first month{a} of the second year from the time Israel did leave Egypt that Moses called Aaron, and his sons, and the Elders{b} of Israel;
[a] The first month on the Hebrew calendar is Abib, today called Nisan; see Abib
[b] The male Elders

2. And he said unto Aaron: Take thee a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before YHVH{a}.
[a] See YHVH

3. And unto the congregation of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering{a}, and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering{b},
[a] See 4 Moses 25; Sin offering
[b] See 4 Moses 26-27; Offering

4. Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings{a}, to sacrifice before YHVH, and a meat offering{b}, mingled with oil; for today YHVH will appear unto you.
[a] See 4 Moses 28; Peace offering
[b] See 4 Moses 26-27; Offering

5. ¶ And it came to pass that they brought that which had Moses instructed before the Tabernacle of the Congregation; and all the congregation drew near and stood before YHVH.

6. And Moses said: This is the thing which YHVH instructed that ye should do; and today YHVH shall appear unto you.

7. And Moses said unto Aaron: Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement{a} for thyself and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them as YHVH required.
[a] The process of a transgression being forgiven; see Atonement, Teshuvah

8. Aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering which was for himself.

9. ¶ And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.

10. But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering he burnt upon the altar as YHVH instructed Moses; and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.

11. ¶ And Aaron slew the burnt{a} offering; and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
[a] Cooked, the offerings were to be eaten

12. And they presented the offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head; and he burnt them upon the altar.

13. And Aaron did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.

14. ¶ And it came to pass that Aaron brought the people's offering and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first; and brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the manner.

15. And Aaron brought the meat offering, and took a handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.

16. ¶ And Aaron slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people; and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,

17. And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver;

18. And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar; and the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before YHVH as Moses instructed.

19. And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the peace offering, and the other offerings.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and came out, and blessed the people and did give them meat to eat from the offerings;

21. And the Glory of YHVH appeared unto all the people, and Miriam and her daughters did lead the congregation in song and in dance before YHVH, the Elohim{a} of Israel.
[a] See Elohim

22. And then there came a fire out from before YHVH and consumed the fat and all that was left that could not be eaten upon the altar;

23. And when all the people saw this, they shouted and fell on their faces and did worship YHVH, their Elohim.

1. And then the Voice{a} of YHVH{b} spake unto Aaron, saying: Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation{c}, or thou shalt be at risk of death;
[a] See The Voice
[b] See YHVH
[c] See Tabernacle

2. And this shall be a statute forever throughout your generations that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between clean and unclean;

3. And that ye may teach my children, Israel, all the statutes which YHVH hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

4. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto his sons, Eleazar, and Ithamar: Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of YHVH made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy, and none shall be wasted.

5. And ye shall eat it in the Holy Place{a} because it is thy due and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of YHVH made by fire, for so I am instructed.
[a] See Holy Place

6. And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy wives, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for they be thy due and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the congregation of Israel.

7. The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before YHVH;

8. And it shall be thine, and thy sons', and thy wives’, and thy daughters’ with thee by a statute forever as YHVH hath instructed.

9. ¶ And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burnt up and could not be eaten;

10. And Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron, saying: Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the Holy Place, seeing it is most holy, and Elohim{a} hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before YHVH?
[a] See Elohim

11. Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the Holy Place; ye should, indeed, have eaten it in the holy place as I commanded.

12. And Aaron said unto Moses: Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their offerings before YHVH;

13. And I too have sinned with them; and if I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted in the sight of YHVH?

14. And when Moses heard this explanation, though he knew it would have been acceptable, he was content.

2. Of a whole piece shalt thou make them, that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeyings of the camps, and the Levites shall blow the trumpets.

[a] See Tabernacle
[b] See YHVH

4. And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves;

5. And when ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward;

6. When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey; they shall blow an alarm for their journeys;

7. But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

8. ¶ And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then the Levites shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before YHVH, your Elohim{a}, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
[a] See Elohim

9. Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, the Levites shall blow with the trumpets over the burnt offerings{a} and over the sacrifices of the peace offerings{b}.
[a] See Offerings
[b] See Peace offerings

10. ¶ And it came to pass that the trumpets were made and were thus given to the Levites throughout the camps, that Levites that were amongst the people could sound the call, even as Moses had spoken, by the will of YHVH.

1. And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month{a}, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the Tabernacle of the Testimony{b}.
[a] The Second month on the Hebrew calendar is Iyar; see Iyar
[b] See Tabernacle

2. And Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of the Mount of Ha’Elohim; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

3. And they first took their journey according to the instructions of YHVH{a}, by the hand of Moses and Zipporah.
[a] See YHVH

4. In the first place went the standard of the camp of the tribe of Judah according to their armies; and over his host was Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.

5. And over the host of the tribe of Issachar was Nethaneel, the son of Zuar.

6. And over the host of the tribe of Zebulun was Eliab, the son of Helon.

7. ¶ And it came to pass that the Tabernacle{a} was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the Tabernacle.
[a] See Tabernacle

8. ¶ And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies; and over his host was Elizur, the son of Shedeur.

9. And over the host of the tribe of Simeon was Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai.

10. And over the host of the tribe of Gad was Eliasaph, the son of Deuel.

11. And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary; and the other did set up the Tabernacle against they came.

12. ¶ And the standard of the camp of Ephraim set forward according to their armies; and over his host was Elishama, the son of Ammihud.

13. And over the host of the tribe of Manasseh was Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur.

14. And over the host of the tribe of Benjamin was Abidan, the son of Gideoni.

15. And the standard of the camp of Dan set forward, which was the rearward of all the camps throughout their hosts; and over his host was Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai.

16. And over the host of the tribe of Asher was Pagiel, the son of Ocran.

17. And over the host of the tribe of Naphtali was Ahira, the son of Enan.

18. Thus were the journeyings of Israel according to their armies when they set forward.

19. ¶ And it came to pass that Zipporah, the wife of Moses went all the way{a} of the earth,
[a] She died

20. And Moses wept, and he called for Jethro, her father, and her sisters, and her brother; and they came and they wept with Moses and his two sons.

21. And after their days of morning had passed, Jethro took his family and left Israel, but Hobab, the brother of Zipporah, did stay with Moses.

22. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses said unto Hobab{a}, the son of Jethro, the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law: We are journeying unto the place of which YHVH said: I will give it you; come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for YHVH hath spoken good concerning Israel.
[a] Hebrew, Chobhabh, "beloved"

23. And Hobab said unto him: I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land and to my kindred.

24. And Moses said: Leave us not, I pray thee, forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.

25. And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be that what goodness YHVH shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

26. And they departed from the mount of Ha’Elohim{a} three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of YHVH went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.
[a] Hebrew, "the gods"

27. And the cloud of YHVH was upon them by day when they went out of the camp.

28. ¶ And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said: Rise up, YHVH and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee!

29. And when it rested, Moses said: Return, O YHVH, unto the many thousands of Israel.

1. And it came to pass that the people complained, and it displeased YHVH{a}; and YHVH heard it; and His anger was kindled;
[a] See YHVH

2. And the fire of YHVH came and burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.

3. And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto YHVH, the fire did stop.

4. And Moses called the name of the place Taberah{a} because the fire of YHVH burnt among them.
[a] Hebrew, "burning"

5. ¶ And it came to pass that the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting after other foods; and Israel also wept again and said: Who shall give us flesh to eat?

6. We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;

7. But now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all besides this manna{a} before our eyes.
[a] Hebrew likely from the Aramaic "man hu," meaning "What is it?" See Manna

8. And the manna was as coriander seed and the color thereof as the color of dar{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "pearl"

9. And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

10. And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses heard the people weep{a} throughout their families, everyone in the door of their tent; and the anger of YHVH was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.
[a] Or "whine"

12. And Moses said unto YHVH: Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? And wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

13. Have I conceived all this people? Have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me: Carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?

14. Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? For they weep unto me, saying: Give us flesh that we may eat!

15. And I am not able to bear all this people alone{a} because it is too heavy for me.
[a] See 3 Moses 43:19 see Doctrines of the Saints 2d:18, 40, 2e:74-75

16. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my own wretchedness.

17. ¶ And YHVH said unto Moses: Gather unto me seventy men and women of the Elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the Elders of the people and officers over them;

18. Bring them unto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that they may stand there with thee and I will come down and talk with thee there.

19. And I will take of the Breath{a} which is upon thee and will put it upon{b} them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh
[b] God wants Israel to be a prophetic people; 

20. And say thou unto the people: Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh.

21. For ye have wept in the ears of YHVH, saying: Who shall give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt; therefore, YHVH will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

22. Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days, nor even a whole month,

23. But ye shall eat of it until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have despised YHVH which is among you,

24. And ye have wept before YHVH, saying: Why came we forth out of Egypt?

25. ¶ And Moses said: The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.

26. Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them?

27. And YHVH said unto Moses: Is the hand of YHVH waxed short? Thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.

28. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses went out, and told the people the words of YHVH, and gathered the seventy men and women of the Elders, and set them round about the Tabernacle.

29. And YHVH came down in a cloud, and spake unto Moses, and took of the Breath that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy Elders.

30. And it came to pass that, when the Breath rested upon these seventy, they prophesied and did not cease;

31. But there two that remained in the camp, and the Breath rested upon them, and they prophesied in the camp.

32. And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said: Two do prophesy in the camp.

33. And Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, spoke, saying: My lord, Moses, forbid them!

34. And Moses said unto him: Enviest thou for my sake? Would YHVH that all the people of YHVH were prophets and that YHVH would put the Breath upon every one of them!

35. And Moses got him into the camp, he and the Elders of Israel.

36. ¶ And it came to pass that there went forth a wind from YHVH, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.

37. And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day; and they gathered the quails; and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.

38. And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of YHVH was kindled against the people; and YHVH smote the people with a very great plague.

39. And Moses called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah{a} because there they buried the people that lusted.
[a] Hebrew, "the graves of desire"

1. And it came to pass that the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto a place in the wilderness, and there they did abode.

2. And there in the wilderness did Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses because of the woman whom he had married{a} and had sent for after the death of Zipporah, his wife;
[a] Moses was a polygamist and sent for one of his wives that had not traveled with Israel

3. For he had married many women as a prince of Egypt, and he did send for Kaashet{a}, one of his wives, to be with him as he sojourned in Israel that he should no longer mourn the passing of Zipporah.
[a] Hebew, "the beautiful woman" 

4. And Miriam said unto Aaron: Hath YHVH indeed, spoken only by Moses? Hath he not spoken also by{a} us{b}? And YHVH did hear it.
[a] Or "to" or "through"
[b] See 3 Moses 2:9-12, 27; 3 Moses 6:1-3

5. ¶ And YHVH spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam: Come out ye three unto the Tabernacle of the Congregation.

6. And they three came out.

7. And YHVH came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the Tabernacle{a}, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
[a] See Tabernacle

8. And the Voice{a} said: Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I, YHVH, will make myself known unto them in a vision and will speak unto them in a dream.
[a] See The Voice

9. But with my servant, Moses behold! with him will I speak face to face{a}, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of YHVH shall he behold;
[a] Face to face: This is a pun or sorts, as this is another way of saying "the Glory of God is upon (him/her)"

10. Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?

11. And the anger of YHVH burned against them, and He departed.

12. ¶ And the cloud departed from off the Tabernacle; and behold, Miriam{a} became tzara’at{b}; and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was cursed.
[a] See Doctrines of the Saints 47:4
[b] See Tzara’at

13. And Aaron said unto Moses: Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned.

14. Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of the womb of his mother.

15. And Moses cried unto YHVH, saying: Heal her now, O God{a}, I beseech thee.
[a] Hebrew, "El;" "God," male, singular; see El

16. And YHVH said unto Moses: If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days; and after that, let her be received in again.

17. ¶ And it came to pass that Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days; and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

1. And it came to pass that the people of Israel removed from their place in the wilderness and pitched in the wilderness elsewhere, that the sins{a} of Aaron and Miriam be forgotten.
[a] See 3 Moses 45:4

2. And there it came to pass that YHVH{a} spake unto Moses, saying: Send thou men that they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto my children, Israel;
[a] See YHVH

3. Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, except Levi, and everyone a ruler among them; but from Levi thou shall send none.

4. And by the instruction of YHVH did Moses sent them from the wilderness; all those men were heads of Israel.

5. ¶ And these were their names:

6. Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua, the son of Zaccur;

7. Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat, the son of Hori;

8. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh;

9. Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal, the son of Joseph;

10. Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel, the son of Sodi.

11. Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel, the son of Gemalli;

12. Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi, the son of Vophsi;

13. Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel, the son of Machi.

14. Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur, the son of Michael;

15. Of the tribe of Joseph, namely of the tribe of Ephraim, Joshua the son of Nun;

16. Of the tribe of Joseph, namely of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi, the son of Susi;

17. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti, the son of Raphu;

18. These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses called Joshua, the son of Nun, to lead them.

19. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them: Get you up this way Southward{a}, and go up into the mountain, and see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;
[a] South representing Holy Ghost, God the Spirit; see Cardinal directions

20. And see the land in which they dwell, whether it it be good or bad, fat or lean, and whether there be wood therein or not;

21. And see the people of the land, and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents or in strongholds;

22. And in this ye shall be of good courage and bring back of the fruit of the land, for now is the time of the first ripe grapes.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that they went up and searched the land from the wilderness and they ascended by the South;

24. And they came unto a brook, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff, and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs.

25. ¶ And it came to pass that the men returned from searching of the land after forty days{a};
[a] Or "a long time;" In the Egyptian this is merely the symbol like a gecko

26. And upon their return, they came unto Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of Israel and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation, and showed unto them the fruit of the land.

27. And they spoke unto Moses saying: We came unto the land whither thou sent us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it;

28. Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and very great; and, moreover, we saw the children of giants{a} there.
[a] In Numbers 13:22, 28, & 33; and Deuteronomy 9:2, they are called the "children of Anak," who is supposed to have been a giant,  and a father of races of giants; not to be confused with the nephilim from 1 Moses 10:11

29. Giants dwell in the land of the south; and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan.

30. ¶ And Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said: Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

31. But the men that went up with him said: We be not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.

32. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched on behalf of Israel, saying: The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.

33. And there we saw the giants, and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers; therefore, so would we be in their sight also.

34. And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.

1. And it came to pass that all of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron all the night, and into the next day.

2. And the whole congregation said unto themsleves: Would Ha’Elohim{a} that we had died in the land of Egypt! or: Would Ha’Elohim that we had died in this wilderness!
[a] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim

3. And: Wherefore hath YHVH{a} brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? and: Were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
[a] See YHVH

4. And thus dis they say one to another: Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.

5. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of Israel.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes;

7. And they spake unto all the company of Israel, saying: The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.

8. If YHVH delight in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it us, a land which floweth with milk and honey.

9. Only rebel not ye against YHVH; neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us; their defense is departed from them, and YHVH is with us; fear them not.

10. And after they had said this, behold, all the congregation bade stone them with stones.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that the Splendor of YHVH{a} appeared in the Tabernacle of the Congregation{b} before all of Israel.
[a] Or "the Holiness of God"
[b] See Tabernacle

12. And YHVH said unto Moses: How long will this people provoke me? And how long will it be before they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?

13. I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

14. And Moses said unto YHVH: Then the Egyptians shall hear it, for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them,

15. And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land; for they have heard that thou, O YHVH, art among this people,

16. That thou, O YHVH, art seen face to face{a}, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them by daytime in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night.
[a] A pun or sorts, as this is another way of saying the Glory of God was upon (him/her)"

17. Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying: Because YHVH was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them, therefore, he hath slain them in the wilderness.

18. ¶ And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord{a} be great, according as thy angel hast spoken{b}, saying: YHVH is long-suffering and of great mercy,
[a] See Adonai
[b] See 3 Moses 23:13-16

19. Forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.

20. Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.

21. ¶ And YHVH spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: How long shall I bear with this evil congregation which does murmur against me?

22. I have heard the murmurings of Israel which they murmur against me; therefore, say unto them: As truly as I live, saith YHVH, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you;

23. Your carcasses{a} shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me.
[a] A contemptuous way of looking at the dead

24. Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, the son of Nun.

25. But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in; and they shall know the land which ye have despised; but as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.

26. And your children shall wander here in the wilderness for forty years{a} and bear your unfaithfulness until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.
[a] A long time

27. After the number of the days in which he searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years; and ye shall know my breach{a} of promise.
[a] Or "curse"

28. I, YHVH, have said: I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me; in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die!

29. And I have pardoned the according to the word of my servant, Moses; but as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the My Glory;

30. And because all those men{a} which have seen my glory and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice, surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers; neither shall any of them that provoked me see it.
[a] See 3 Moses 6:31, 23:15

31. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

32. Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness, following the path along the sea.

33. ¶ And it came to pass that the men which Moses sent to search the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land, even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before YHVH.

34. But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.

35. And it came to pass that Moses told these sayings unto all of Israel; and the people mourned greatly.

36. ¶ And it came to pass that a part of the people rose up early in the morning and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying: Lo, we be here and will go up unto the place which YHVH hath promised; for it is ours!

37. And Moses said: Wherefore now do ye transgress the mouth of YHVH? YHVH hath said ye shall not go, therefore ye shall not prosper;

38. Go not up, for YHVH is not among you, least ye be smitten by your enemies, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye are turned away from YHVH, therefore, YHVH will not be with you.

39. But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop; nevertheless, the ark of the covenant of YHVH and Moses departed not out of the camp.

40. Then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill and smote them and discomfited them.

chapter-aka: The Fall of Israel
1. And it came to pass that when they{a} failed to obtain the land of promise, Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men;
[a] see 3 Moses 47:39- 40, Numbers 14:44-45

2. And they rose up before Moses with certain men of Israel, two hundred and fifty heads of the assembly, well known in the congregation, men of renown;

3. And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them: Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and YHVH{a} is among us.
[a] See YHVH

4. Wherefore, then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of YHVH?

5. ¶ And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face, and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying: Even tomorrow YHVH will show who are His and who is holy and will cause to come near unto Him; even they whom He hath chosen will He cause to come near unto him.

6. And Moses said unto Korah and all his company: This do: Take you censers and put fire therein, and put incense in them before YHVH tomorrow; and it shall be that those whom YHVH doth choose, they shall be holy; ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

7. Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi; it seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the Elohim{a} of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the Tabernaclea of YHVH, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?
[a] Hebrew, "Gods;" see Elohim

8. And YHVH hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren, the sons of Levi, with thee, and seek ye the High Priesthood{a} also?
[a] See High Priesthood

9. Therefore, both thou and all thy company are gathered together against YHVH; and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?

10. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, which said: We will not come up.

11. Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a king over us?

12. Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.

13. And it came to pass that after this, Moses was very wroth and said unto YHVH: Respect not thou their offering; I have not taken one ass from them; neither have I hurt one of them.

14. ¶ And it came to pass that the following day, they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation{a} with Moses and Aaron.
[a] See Tabernacle

15. And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation; and the Glory of YHVH{a} appeared unto all the congregation.
[a] See Glory of YHVH

16. And YHVH spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.

17. And Moses and Aaron fell upon their faces and said: O YHVH, Elohim of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?

18. And YHVH spake unto Moses, saying: Speak unto the congregation, saying: Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

19. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the Elders of Israel followed him.

20. And Aaron spoke unto the congregation for Moses, saying: Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed{a} in all their sins.
[a] Referring here to both spiritual and  physical death

21. So they got up from the tesnt of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.

22. And Moses said: Hereby ye shall know that YHVH hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own heart;

23. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then YHVH hath not sent me,

24. But if YHVH make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men have provoked YHVH.

25. ¶ And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground that was under them split apart and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.

26. They and all that belonged to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them; and they perished from among the congregation.

27. And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said: Lest the earth swallow us up also.

28. And there came out a fire from YHVH and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

29. ¶ And it came to pass that on the next day that all the congregation of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying: Ye have killed the people of YHVH.

30. And it came to pass that when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the Tabernacle of the Congregation; and behold, the cloud covered it, and the Glory of YHVH appeared.

31. And Moses and Aaron came before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and YHVH spake unto Moses, saying: Get you up from among this congregation{a}, that I may consume{b} them as in a moment.
[a] Or "this people"
[b] Or "devour" or "destroy;" to destroy completely

32. And Moses and Aaron fell upon their faces, and Moses said unto Aaron: Take a censer{a}, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense{b}, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from YHVH; the plague{c} is begun.
[a] An incense container
[b] An exorcistic technique of fumigation by incense by "cleaning" the air to chase away any unclean spirits
[c] See Tzara’at

33. And Aaron took as Moses instructed and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague{a} was begun among the people; and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people.
[a] A supernatural death; this appears to be a physical illness leading to death caused by a spiritual condition

34. And Aaron stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.

35. ¶ And it came to pass that they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah{a}.
[a] See 3 Moses 48:25-28

36. And it came to pass that Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation; and the plague was stayed.

2. And YHVH spake unto Moses, saying: Speak unto Israel and take of every one of them a rod{a} according to the house of their fathers, of all heads of their houses according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods; write thou every the name of man upon his rod.
[a] See Rod

3. And thou shalt write the name of Aaron upon the rod of Levi; for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers;

4. And in the Tabernacle of the Congregation{a} thou shalt lay them up before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
[a] See Tabernacle

5. And it shall come to pass that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall blossom; and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

6. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses spake unto Israel; and every one of the heads of their houses gave him a rod apiece, for each head one, according to the houses of their fathers, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.

7. And Moses laid up the rods before YHVH in the Tabernacle of Witness{a}.
[a] See Tabernacle

8. And it came to pass that on the morrow, Moses went into the Tabernacle of Witness; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.

9. And Moses brought out all the rods from before YHVH unto all of Israel; and they looked and took every man his rod.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses: Bring the rod of Aaron again before the Testimony{a}, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
[a] See Ark of the Covenant

11. And Moses did so; as YHVH instructed him, so did he.

12. And Israel spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, we die; we perish; we all perish! Whosoever cometh anything near unto the Tabernacle of YHVH shall die; should we all perish then?

1. And it came to pass that the whole congregation Israel went into the desert in the first month{a} of the fortieth year after leaving Egypt;
[a] See Abib

2. And while the people abode there, Miriam died and was buried in that place.

3. And all of Israel mourned for 30 days, for Miriam did teach the women in all the ways of YHVH{a}, even as Moses did teach{b} the men, and she did lead{c} the Priestesses, even as Aaron did lead the Priests.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See 3 Moses 23:15
[c] See 21:22, 22:7

4. ¶ And it came to pass that there was no water for the congregation; and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

5. And the people did chide{a} with Moses and spake, saying: Would that we had died when our brethren died before YHVH!
[a] Or "rebuke Moses"

6. And: Why have ye brought up the congregation of YHVH into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die here?

7. And: Wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.

8. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses and Aaron went from the Presence of the Assembly{a} unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation{b}, and they fell upon their faces; and the Glory of YHVH{c} appeared unto them.
[a] See Shekinah, the Congregation
[b] See Tabernacle
[c] See Glory of YHVH

9. And YHVH spake unto Moses, saying: Take thy rod{a}, and gather thou the assembly together, thou and Aaron, thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes;
[a] See Rod

10. And it shall give forth her water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.

11. ¶ And so it was that Moses took the rod from before the Presence{a} of YHVH as YHVH commanded him.
[a] See Shekinah

12. And Moses and Aaron gathered together the congregation before the rock, and Aaron said unto them: Hear now, ye rebels! Must we fetch you water out of this rock?

13. And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice; and the water came out abundantly; and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.

14. ¶ And the Priestesses sang this song: Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it;

15. The princes dug the well;

16. The nobles of the people dug it,

17. By the direction of the Lawgiver{a}, with their staves.
[a] Moses

18. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying: Because ye believed me not{a}, to sanctify me in the eyes of my children, Israel; therefore, ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
[a] See 3 Moses 50:12; Aaron have credit to himself and Moses, not to YHVH

19. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom: Thus saith thy brother, Israel: Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us,

20. How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians vexed us and our fathers;

21. And when we cried unto YHVH, He heard our voice, and sent an angel{a}, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt; and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.
[a] See 3 Moses 3-4, 6:1-3

22. Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards; neither will we drink of the water of the wells;

23. But we shall go by the highway of the king; we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders.

24. ¶ And it came to pass that Edom said unto him: Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.

25. And Israel said unto him: We will go by the highway; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it; I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.

26. And Edom said: Thou shalt not go through.

27. And it came to pass that Edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand;

28. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border; wherefore, Israel turned away from him.

29. ¶ And it came to pass in that same year, that Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from their place in the wilderness and came unto a certain mountain.

30. And YHVH spake unto Moses and Aaron there, saying: Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto Israel because ye rebelled against my Word when ye broke forth the waters from that rock{a}.
[a] See 3 Moses 50:12

31. Take Aaron and Eleazar, his son, and bring them up unto this mountain, and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar, his son; and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there.

32. And it came to pass that Moses did as YHVH instructed; and they went up into that mountain in the sight of all the congregation of Israel.

33. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them upon Eleazar, his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

34. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

chapter-aka: The Brass Serpent

1. And it came to pass that when the king of the Canaanites, which dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies, then he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoners.

2. And Israel vowed a vow unto YHVH{a} and said: If thou wilt, indeed, deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
[a] See YHVH

3. And YHVH did hearken unto the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities.

4. ¶ And it came to pass that Israel journeyed from the mountain by the way of the path along the sea, to compass the land of Edom; and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.

5. And the people spake against Elohim{a} and against Moses: Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread; neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
[a] See Elohim

6. And it came to pass that YHVH was sore in His wrath against them, and sent fiery serpents{a} among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died;
[a] These may have been real, poisonous serpents or angels known as seraphim sent by YHVH to torment a rebellious Israel; see Saraph

7. Therefore, the people came to Moses and said: We have sinned, for we have spoken against YHVH and against thee; pray unto YHVH that he take away the serpents from us!

8. And Moses prayed on behalf of the people.

9. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said unto Moses: Make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live;

10. But they who shall not look, these shall parish, and this shall be as a sign unto my children, Israel, of the easiness of my ways, should they hear and head my Voice{a}.
[a] See The Voice

11. And it came to pass that Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten one of Israel, when they beheld the serpent of brass, they lived;

12. But if they would not look, for the simpleness of the task, them they were taken to the grave{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "sheol," the place where both the righteous and the unrighteous go when they die

chapter-aka: The Angel and the Ass

1. And it came to pass that Israel sent messengers unto the king of the Amorites, saying: Let me pass through thy land;

2. We will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well; but we will go along by the highway of the king until we be past thy borders.

3. But the king of the Amorites would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; but he did gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness and fought against Israel.

4. ¶ And it came to pass that Israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok.

5. And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all the villages thereof;

6. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

7. Thus did Israel dwell in the land of the Amorites.

8. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses sent to spy out Jaazer; and they took the villages thereof and drove out the Amorites that were there.

9. And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and the king of Bashan, went out against them, he and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.

10. And YHVH said unto Moses: Fear him not; for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto the king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

11. So it was that Israel smote him, and his sons, and all his people until there was none left him alive; and they possessed his land.

12. And so it was that Israel set forward and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side of Jordan by Jericho.

13. ¶ And it came to pass that the king of Moab, who was Balak, the son of Zippor, saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

14. And Balak sent messengers unto Balaam{a} the prophet, the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people.
[a] A a non-Israelite prophet of YHVH; while 3 Moses views him as a righteous prophet that obeys God, Numbers 22–24 has him helping king Balak curse the Israelites; see also 2 Peter 2:15, Jude 1:11, Revelation 2:14

15. And Balak called to Balaam, saying: Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.

16. Come now, therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

17. And it came to pass that Balaam said unto the messengers: Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again as YHVH{a} shall speak unto me; and the messengers abode with Balaam.
[a] See YHVH

18. And El Elyon{a} came unto Balaam and said: What men are these with thee?
[a] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon

19. And Balaam said unto Elohim: Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying: Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth; come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out.

20. And El Elyon said unto Balaam: Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people, for they are blessed.

21. And Balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the messengers of Balak: Get you into your land; for YHVH refuseth to give me leave to go with you.

22. And the messengers of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak and said: Balaam refuseth to come with us.

23. ¶ And it came to pass that Balak grew more troubled in his heart, and he sent messengers, even princes,

24. And they came to Balaam and said to him: Thus saith Balak, the son of Zippor: Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me;

25. For I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me; come, therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.

26. And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak: If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of YHVH, my Elohim to do less or more;

27. Now, therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what YHVH will say unto me more.

28. And El Elyon came unto Balaam at night and said unto him: If the men come to call thee, rise up if thou wilt go with them; but yet only the words which I shall say unto thee shalt thou speak.

29. ¶ And it came to pass that Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.

30. And the anger of Ha’Elohim{a} was kindled because{b} he went; and the angel of YHVH{c} stood in the way for an adversary against him.
[a] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim
[b] See Angel of YHVH
[c] God originally told Balaam not to go; see Avahr 11

31. And it came to pass that he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him, and the ass saw the angel of YHVH standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand;

32. And the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way.

33. But the angel of YHVH stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side and a wall on that side.

34. And when the ass saw the angel of YHVH, she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he smote her again.

35. And the angel of YHVH went further and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

36. And when the ass saw the angel of YHVH, she fell down under Balaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.

37. And YHVH did open the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam: What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?

38. And Balaam said unto the ass: Because thou hast mocked me; I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.

39. And the ass said unto Balaam: Am not I thine ass upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? Was I ever wont to do so unto thee?

40. And Balaam said: Nay.

41. Then YHVH opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of YHVH standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face.

42. And the angel of YHVH said unto him: Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times?

43. Behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me.

44. And the ass saw me and turned from me these three times; unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee and saved her alive.

45. And Balaam said unto the angel of YHVH: I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me.

46. Now, therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

47. And the angel of YHVH said unto Balaam: Go with the men; but only the word that the Voice{a} shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.

chapter-aka: Balaam, Prophet of YHVH, Blesses Israel

1. And it came to pass that Balaam went with the messangers of Balak, and when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab.

2. And Balak said unto Balaam: Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? Wherefore camest thou not unto me? Am I not able, indeed, to promote thee to honor?

3. And Balaam said unto Balak: Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to say anything? The Word that Ha’Elohim{a} putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

4. ¶ And it came to pass that Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto the city of the streets.

5. And Balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to Balaam and to the men that were with him.

6. And it came to pass, on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.

7. And Balaam said unto Balak: Build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

8. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

9. And Balaam said unto Balak: Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go; peradventure YHVH{a} will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee.
[a] See YHVH

10. ¶ And Balaam went to a high place, and there the angel of YHVH{a} met Balaam; and Balaam said: I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

11. And the Voice{a} put a word into the mouth of Balaam and the angel of YHVH said: Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
[a] The Holy Spirit, see The Voice

12. And Balaam returned unto Balak, and lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the leaders of Moab.

13. And Balaam took up to prophesy, saying: Balak, the king of Moab, hath brought me from out of the mountains of the East, saying: Come, curse me the house of Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

14. How shall I curse whom El Elyon{a} hath not cursed? Or how shall I defy whom YHVH hath not defied?
[a] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon

15. For from the top of the rocks I see Him, and from the hills I behold Him; lo, the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations.

16. Who can count the dust of the seed of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!

17. ¶ And Balak hear all this and said unto Balaam: What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.

18. And Balaam answered and said: Must I not take heed to speak that which YHVH hath put in my mouth?

19. And Balak said unto him: Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from thence.

20. And Balak brought Balaam into the summit of mountain of the Iyrin{a}, unto the cleft of the mountain, and there built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
[a] Hebrew, "awake," or "watchfull;" in the Book of Enoch "Iyrin" is typically translated as "Watchers," see Enoch Book of the Watchers; Iyrin are also mentioned in the Book of Daniel, see Daniel 4:13, 13, 27

21. And it came to pass that Balaam said unto Balak: Stand here by thy burnt offering while I meet YHVH yonder.

22. And the angel YHVH met Balaam, and the Voice again put the Word in his mouth, and the angel of YHVH said: Go again unto Balak and say thus.

23. And when Balaam came to Balak, behold, he stood by the burnt offering, and the chieftains of Moab with him.

24. And Balak said unto him: What hath YHVH spoken?

25. And Balaam opened his mouth and prophesied, saying: Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor;

26. YHVH is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man{a}, that He should repent.
[a] Or "son of Adam;" a way to contrast the lowly status of humanity against the exalted glory of God; see Psalm 8:4

27. And what YHVH said, shall He not do it? Or what He hath spoken, and shall He not make it good?

28. Behold, I have received the instruction to bless; and YHVH hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

29. Ha’Elohim hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; neither hath Ha’Elohim seen perverseness in Israel; YHVH, the Elohim{a} of Israel, is with them, and the battle cry of Melchizedek{b} is among them.
[a] Hebrew, "Gods;" see Elohim
[b] The battle cry of the king of peace would be peace, this may also be a nod to the power of the High Priesthood; see Melchizedek

30. Ha’Elohim hath brought Israel out of Egypt; Israel hath, as it were, the strength of a wild ox;

31. Surely there is no enchantment{a} against Israel; neither is there any divination against Israel; according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel: What hath God{b} wrought!
[a] Hebrew masculine noun "nakh’ash," meaning "divination," "prophesying against," cursing," or "enchanting."
[b] Hebrew, "El," meaning "god" (singular) or "strength;" see El

32. Behold, the people of Israel shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up as a young lion; they shall not lie down until they shall eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain.

33. And Balak said unto Balaam: What sayest thou? Doth thou seeketh to destry me? Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!

34. But Balaam answered and said unto Balak: Did I not warn thee, saying: All that YHVH speaketh, that I must do?

35. But Balak sought still to sway Balaam, prophet of YHVH.

2. And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.

3. And Balaam said unto Balak: Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

4. And Balak did as Balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.

5. And it came to pass that when Balaam saw that it pleased YHVH{a} to bless Israel, he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments{b}, but he set his face toward the wilderness{c}.
[a] See YHVH

6. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the Breath of Elohim{a} came upon him.
[a] See Ruach HaKodesh

7. ¶ And Balaam again opened his mouth, saying: The prophecy of Balaam, the son of Beor; he whose eyes are open;

8. The prophecy of he who heard the words of El Elyon{a}, which saw the vision of Elohim Shaddai{b}, falling into a trance but having his eyes open:
[a] See El Elyon
[b] "God(s) Almighty," or the Almighty God(s)" 

9. How goodly are thy tents, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!

10. As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the side of the river, as the trees of aloe which YHVH hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters!

11. She shall pour the water out of her buckets, and her seed shall be in many waters, and her King, who is YHVH, shall be higher than the king of Amalek; and the kingdom of Israel shall be exalted!

12. El Elyon brought Israel forth out of Egypt; she hath as it were the strength of a wild ox; Israel shall eat up the nations of her enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with her arrows.

13. Israel hath been brought low by YHVH, yet she lay down as a lion, even as a great lion; and who shall stir her up?

14. Blessed are they that blesseth Israel, and cursed are they that curseth her; therefore show her kindness that YHVH should have mercy on you.

15. ¶ And it came to pass that the anger of Balakwas kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times;

16. Therefore, now flee thou to thy place; I thought to promote thee unto great honor; but lo, YHVH hath kept thee back from honor.

17. And Balaam said unto Balak: Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying: If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of YHVH, to do either good or bad of mine own heart?

18. I shall not lie for thee, but what YHVH saith, that will I speak.

19. ¶ And now, behold, I go unto my people; come, therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.

20. And Balaam prophesied: Balaam, the son of Beor, hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

21. He hath said, which heard the words of El Elyon and knew the knowledge of the Most High{a}, which saw the vision of Elohim Shaddai, falling into a trance but having his eyes open,
[a] Hebrew, Elyon

22. I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh; there shall come a Star out of Jacob{a}, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
[a] A messianic prophecy; some see this "star" as King David, others as Jesus Christ; some see it as both; many have claimed this title, but were unable to fulfill the prophecy

23. And Edom{a} shall be a possession; Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

24. Out of Israel shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.

25. ¶ And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable and said: Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be that he perish forever.

26. ¶ And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his prophecy, and said: Strong is thy dwelling place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock;

27. Nevertheless, the Kenite shall be wasted until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.

28. ¶ And he took up his prophecy, saying: Alas, who shall live when El Elyon doeth this?

29. And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber{a}; and he also shall perish forever.
[a] Eber was a greatgrandson of Noah's son Shem and the father of Peleg, a distant ancestor of Abraham

30. And Balaam rose up, and went, and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.

1. And it came to pass that when Israel abode in Shittim, the people began to commit whoredoms with the daughters of Moab, even as YHVH{a} had warned{b};
[a] See YHVH
[b] See 4 Moses 5:4-9

2. For the people of Moab called the people of Israel unto the sacrifices of their elohim{a}; and the people did eat and bowed down to their elohim.
[a] See Elohim of man

3. And Israel joined in the house of Peor{a}, an elohim of the Moabites; and the anger of YHVH was kindled against Israel.
[a] Or "Baal of Peor," an unknown god of the Moabites; based on the text, it appears to be a house of prostitution

4. And it came to pass that YHVH sent a plague{a} and many of the men of Israel died.
[a] Implying a sexually transmitted disease; this plague seems to have been spread by the men of Israel having sex women in the house of Peor 

5. ¶ And it came to pass, after the plague, that the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh, the son of Joseph came unto Moses and Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest;

6. And Zelophehad{a}, the son of Hepher, had no sons, but daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
[a] The five daughters of Zelophehad provides legitimation of a limited right of Israelite women to inherit land; see also Numbers 36

7. And these, the daughters of Zelophehad stood before Moses, and before Eleazar, the Priest, and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation{a}, saying: Our father died in the wilderness,
[a] See Tabernacle

8. And he was not in the company of they that gathered themselves together against YHVH in the company of Korah, but died in his own sin{a} and had no sons.
[a] See 5 Moses 28:7, Deuteronomy 24:16

9. Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he hath no son?

10. Give unto us, therefore, a possession among the brethren of our father.

11. ¶ And it came to pass that Moses brought their cause before YHVH.

12. And YHVH spake unto Moses, saying: The daughters of Zelophehad speak right; thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.

13. ¶ These are the families of Manasseh and those that were numbered of them, these are the sons of Ephraim after their families: of Shuthelah, the family of the Shuthalhites; of Becher, the family of the Bachrites; of Tahan, the family of the Tahanites.

14. And these are the sons of Shuthelah: of Eran, the family of the Eranites.

15. These are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and five hundred; these are the sons of Joseph after their families.

16. And YHVH spoke unto Moses, saying: These are the names of those which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar, the Priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun.

17. And ye shall take one to be the head of every tribe to divide the land by inheritance.

18. And the names of the men are these: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh;

19. And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel, the son of Ammihud;

20. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad, the son of Chislon;

21. And the head of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki, the son of Jogli;

22. The head of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel, the son of Ephod;

23. And the head of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel, the son of Shiphtan;

24. And the head of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan, the son of Parnach;

25. And the head of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel, the son of Azzan;

26. And the head of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud, the son of Shelomi;

27. And the head of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel, the son of Ammihud.

28. These are they whom YHVH instructed to divide the inheritance unto Israel in the land of Canaan.

29. ¶ And it came to pass that the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spake before Moses and before the princes, the chief fathers of Israel;

30. And they said: YHVH instructed my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to Israel; and my lord was instructed by YHVH to give the inheritance of Zelophehad, our brother, unto his daughters.

31. And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received; so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

32. And when the jubilee of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe where unto they are received; so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

33. ¶ And Moses instructed Israel according to the word of YHVH, saying: The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.

34. Concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, this is the thing which YHVH doth command, saying: Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their fathers shall they marry.

35. So shall the inheritance of Israel not be removed from tribe to tribe; for every one of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

36. And every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of Israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that Israel may enjoy, everyone, the inheritance of his fathers.

37. Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of Israel shall keep themselves to their own inheritance.

38. Even as YHVH commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad;

39. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons;

40. And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.

chapter-aka: Moses is Taken

1. And it came to pass that the angel of YHVH{a} came unto Moses, saying: Get thee up into the Mount and see the land which YHVH{b} hath given unto His Israel.
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] See YHVH

2. And when thou hast seen it, thou shalt be taken; for ye rebelled against my instruction in the desert{a}, in the strife of the congregation thou didst not sanctify me at the water before their eyes.
[a] See 3 Moses 50:18

3. And Moses spake unto the angel of YHVH, saying: Let YHVH, and the Elohim{a} of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in,
[a] See Ha'Elohim

4. And this that the congregation of YHVH be not as sheep which have no shepherd.

5. And the angel of YHVH spake unto Moses, saying: Take thee Joshua{a}, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;
[a] See 3 Moses 1:3-5

6. And set him before Eleazar{a}, the Priest, and before all the congregation, and give him a charge in their sight.
[a] See 3 Moses 50:33-34

7. And thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of my children, Israel, may be obedient.

8. ¶ And Joshua shall stand before Eleazar, the Priest, who shall ask counsel for him by way of the judgment of the Urim and Thummim{a} before me; thus sayeth YHVH;
[a] See Urim & Thummim

9. At his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all of Israel, with him, even all of the congregation.

10. And it came to pass that Moses did as the angel of YHVH instructed him;

11. And he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar, the Priest, and before all the congregation; and he laid his hands upon Joshua blessed him and gave him a charge as the angel of YHVH had instructed.

12. And it came to pass that Moses went up the mount, even as the angel of YHVH had instructed, and he took with him Joshua;

13. But part way up the mount, he left Joshua and went alone unto the Face of YHVH.

14. And there YHVH did show him all the land of Gilead unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah unto the utmost sea,

15. And the South, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

16. And YHVH said unto him: This is the land which I swore unto thy father Abraham, unto thy father Isaac, and unto thy father Jacob, saying: I will give it unto thy seed;

17. I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

18. And it came to pass that Moses, the servant of YHVH, was taken up there, according to the word of YHVH;

19. For YHVH took him from that mount unto his fathers; therefore, he hath no sepulcher{a} unto this day.
[a] Or "grave"

20. And Moses was of the one hundred and twenty-fifth degree when he died{a}; his eyes were not dim nor his natural force abated.
[a] Or "breathed his last;" there appears to be confusion as to what happened to Moses; see Alma 21:21a-22a RAV, 45:19 OPV

21. ¶ And it came to pass that Joshua went up, and found him not; but there upon a rock he did find the Torah{a} that Moses had brought up with him.
[a] See 4 Moses

22. And the people of Israel wept for Moses thirty days; so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.

23. And Joshua, the son of Nun, was full of the Spirit of Wisdom{a}; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and Israel hearkened unto him and did as YHVH instructed Moses.
[a] See Shekinah, Book of Remembrance 2:11

24. And it was said that Moses tasted not death{a}; for he was, and then YHVH took him, and he was found upon the earth no more.
