chapter-aka: The Covenant of the Passover

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} spake unto Moses and Zipporah in the land of Egypt, saying: This month shall be unto you the beginning of months{b}; it shall be the first month of the year to you.
[a] See YHVH
[b] The first month in the Hebrew calendar is month of Abib, today called Nisan; see Abi

2. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying: In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them everyone a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house;

3. And if the household be too little for the lamb, let they and their neighbor next unto their house take it according to the number of the souls; everyone according to their needs shall make your count for the lamb:

4. And this shall be a lamb without blemish, a male of the first year; thou shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats;

5. And thou shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs in the evening,

6. And they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it.

7. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

8. Thou shalt not eat of it raw, nor shalt thou cook it with water; but roast the lamb with fire— his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereof.

9. And thou shall eat of it, wasting nothing; yea, let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning thou shall burn with fire; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

10. ¶ And thus shall thou eat it: with thy loins girded, thy shoes on thy feet, and thy staff in thine hand; and thou shall eat it in haste; for it is the Passover of YHVH.

11. For I will pass through the land as a thief in the night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the elohim{a} of thy enemies I will execute judgment; I am YHVH.
[a] See Elohim of man

12. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house where thou are;

13. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite{a} the land.
[a] Wound or strike down

14. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and thou shall keep it a feast to me, YHVH thy Elohim, throughout your generations; thou shall keep it a feast by an ordinance{a} forever; I am YHVH.
[a] Hebrew, "chuqqah;" an enactment or statute; see Ordinance

15. ¶ And for Seven days shall thou eat unleavened bread; even the first day thou shall put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread, from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

16. And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you;

17. No manner of work shall be done in them, save that which everyone must eat, this only may be done of you.

18. And thou shall observe the feast of leavened bread; for on this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt; therefore shall thou observe this day in your generations by an ordinance forever;

19. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at the evening, thou shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month in the evening.

20. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether they be a stranger or born in the land;

21. Thou shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

22. ¶ And thou shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of your houses until the morning.

23. For I, YHVH, will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when I seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, I will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you;

24. And thou shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy children forever.

25. ¶ And it shall come to pass that when thou shall come into the land which I will give thee, according as I hath promised, that thou, Israel, shall keep this ordinance.

26. And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you: What mean ye by this sacrament{a}?
[a] Hebrew, "abodah;" "labor" or "service"

27. And thou shall say unto them: It is the sacrifice of the Passover of YHVH, who passed over the houses{a} of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.
[a] See 3 Moses 18

28. ¶ This is the ordinance of the Passover; there shall no stranger eat thereof;

29. But even thy servants that are bought for money, when thou hast converted them, then shall they eat thereof.

30. But those foreign to YHVH, they that know me not, these shall not eat thereof.

31. And in one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out{a} of the house; neither shall thou break a bone thereof.
[a] Food must be eaten in the house, no one can leave that day

32. And all of the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

33. And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep my Passover, let them come near and keep it; and they shall be as one that is born in the land;

34. One Torah{a} shall be to they that are born among you, and one Torah unto the stranger that sojourneth among you; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

chapter-aka: The Mitzvah of the Seventh Day Sabbath

1. And it came to pass that YHVH{a} spoke unto Moses and Zipporah in the wilderness, saying: Write out the mystery of my creation, for in six ages did YHVH Elohim{b} finished all the works of this creation,
[a] See YHVH
[b] See YHVH Elohim

2. And the Sabbath{a} was kept by YHVH and the Elohim{b} in the seventh age{c}, and it is hallowed for all ages, and appointed as a sign for all the works of YHVH Elohim.
[a] Sabbath: Hebrew, "rest;" see Sabbath
[b] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim
[c] See 1 Moses 3:47-49, Book of Remembrance 3:69-73

3. ¶ And in the first age{a} did Elohim create the heavens which are above and all the spirits{b}; the angels{c}, and the breath of fire{d}, and the spirit of the winds{e} ;
[a] See 1 Moses 3:6-11, Genesis 1:3-5, Book of Remembrance 3:3-11

[e] The four winds can represent God's judgment; see Revelation 7:1

4. And thus did Ha’Elohim divide the light from the darkness, opening the heavens, that the abyss and the darkness should be broken;

5. And that the light which Ha’Elohim had prepared from before the beginning should be found in the heart of the creation.

6. And thereupon the Morning Stars{a} saw these works, and sang their praises; for great were the works of Ha’Elohim on the first day.
[a] Hebrew, "boqer kochvei;" this reference is similar to Job 38:7 and may be a reference to the Saints becoming join heirs with Jesus Christ (Romans 8:17); see Morning Star

7. ¶ And in the second age{a} Elohim{b} created the firmament in the midst of the waters,
[a] See 1 Moses 3:12-15, Genesis 1:6-8, Book of Remembrance 3:12-18
[b] Hebrew, "gods;" see 1 Moses 3:3, Elohim

8. And the waters were divided between the firmament that is the midst over the face of the whole earth, and the waters below the earth and in the abyss.

9. ¶ And in the third age{a} Ha’Elohim commanded the waters to divide from the earth that dry land should appear.
[a] See 1 Moses 3:16-22, Genesis 1:9-13, Book of Remembrance 3:19-29

10. And the waters did as they were instructed, and they slept in the firmament, and the dry land appeared, and when the Heavens wept the Earth was made fertile.

11. And in that age the seas were created, and the rivers, and all the gatherings of the waters upon the earth, and the dew of the earth;

12. And because of this, the seeds were sown, and plants, and trees, all manor of shrubs were birthed in Eden, and Her garden was full upon the earth.

13. ¶ And in the fourth age{a} Elohim birthed the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and set them in the firmament of the heavens;
[a] See 1 Moses 3:23-30, Genesis 1:14-19, Book of Remembrance 3:30-41

14. And these were give unto the earth to give light upon all the creation, and to rule over the day and the night, and divide the light from the darkness, that all things may prosper which should grow on the earth.

15. And YHVH appointed the sun and the moon to be great signs for the earth; for days, and for Sabbaths, and for months, and for feasts, and for years, and for all the seasons of the years;

16. And this too, that the will of Ha’Elohim should be known, as the Word of Ha’Elohim is written upon the skies.

17. ¶ And in the fifth age{a} Elohim created the monsters of the deep, and the fish, and everything that moveth in the waters; the first of flesh upon the earth;
[a] See 1 Moses 3:31-35, Genesis 1:20-23, Book of Remembrance 3:42-50

18. And Elohim created birds, and the insects, and everything that flies{a}, and all their kind;
[a] Or "soars"

19. Yea, everything that was above the earth, and everything that is below the earth, and everything that shoots out of the earth that are flesh.

20. ¶ And in the sixth age{a} Elohim created all the creatures of the earth, and all cattle, and everything that moves upon the face of the earth.
[a] See 1 Moses 3:36-46, Genesis 1:24-31, Book of Remembrance 3:51-66

21. Yeah, And after all this did Ha’Elohim create Adam{a}, both male and female created They them.
[a] Hebrew, "mankind," or "humans"

22. And it came to pass that I, YHVH, gave the people that were created charge{a} over all that is upon the earth, and all that is in the seas, and all that flies above the earth;
[a] Or "stewardship"

23. And mankind{a} was given charge over all beasts of the deserts, and forests, and the mountains, and over cattle and the herds, and over everything that moves upon the earth, and over the creation upon the whole earth.
[a] Hebrew, "Adam"

24. ¶ And Ha’Elohim finished all Their works in the sixth age; yea, all the works in the Heavens, and on the Earth, and in the abyss, and in the light, and in the darkness, and in everything;

25. And this was given unto mankind as a sign, that we may remember the Sabbath day:

26. That mankind should work six days, but keep Sabbath on the seventh day holy, for this is the seventh age{a}, and it is the Sabbath of YHVH, for I am Lord of the Sabbath;
[a] See 1 Moses 3:47-50, Genesis 2:1-3, Book of Remembrance 3:67-73

27. And all the malakim{a} that Ha’Elohim hath send fourth hath given mankind this mitzvah{b}: To keep the Sabbath with me both in heaven and on earth, that the earth and the heavens be one{c}.
[a] Hebrew, "angels," "messengers," or "envoys;" see Malak
[b] Hebrew, "tradition," "commandment" or "obligation"
[c] See Matthew 6:10; Luke 11:2; 3 Nephi 5:103 RAV, 13:10 OPV

28. And I, YHVH, say unto you: Behold, I will separate unto Myself a people from among all of mankind made by Ha’Elohim, and these shall keep the Sabbath day,

29. And I will sanctify them unto Myself, and I will set the apart as My people, and I will bless them;

30. And even as I have sanctified the Sabbath and do sanctify it unto myself, even so will I bless Israel; and they shall be My people, and I will be their Elohim; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

31. And I have sent malakim unto all mankind that walketh upon the earth, and I have chosen the seed of Jacob to be my Israel{a} from amongst all that I have seen,
[a] See Israel

32. And have written Jacob down as my first-born, and have sanctified him unto myself forever and ever;

33. And I will teach my Israel the mitzvah of the Sabbath day, that they may keep Sabbath thereon that they might rest from their labors, that they put their faith in me, and rest not upon the arm of the flesh; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

34. ¶ And thus have I created therein a sign in this, that Israel should keep the Sabbath with Ha’Elohim on the seventh day; to eat, and to drink, and to bless me, YHVH, the Creator{a} of all things;
[a] Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh: The Creator, or "I AM that I AM," or "I AM (the One) that Makes/Creates"

35. And as I have blessed and sanctified unto myself a peculiar people above all peoples, and they that keep my everlasting covenant{a} shall join in and keep my Sabbath together and be my Israel:
[a] A covenant passed down from generation to generation

36. For upon My Word were the heavens and earth and everything in them created in the six ages, and Elohim did make the seventh age holy;

37. Therefore I, YHVH, instruct thee on behalf of the Sabbath: Whoever does any work thereon shall be marked as one that hath fallen off the path, and that they who defiles it shall not be found in Israel; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

38. Wherefore, give my mitzvah unto all my children, Israel, to observe this day that they may keep it holy and not to defile it, as it is holier than all other days; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

39. And whoever profanes it shall surely be in tribulation, that my children, Israel, may observe this day throughout their generations, and not be uprooted from out of the land of their inheritance.

40. And all they who observe and keep the Sabbath will be holy and blessed throughout all days, and shall stand as a reminder to those that abandon Israel for other elohim{a} of the flesh, that they might walk in teshuvah{b} and be my Israel once more; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.
[a] See Elohim of man
[b] See Teshuvah

41. I give thee charge this day, say to my children, Israel: The Torah{a} of this day, both that they should keep Sabbath thereon, and that they should not forsake it in their hearts{b};
[a] Hebrew, "Law," "Instructions," or "Teachings"
[b] In the ancient world the heart was understood to be the inner part referring to one’s will, mind, consciousness, emotions and understanding; one’s moral character and determination; the place of knowledge, memory and reflection

42. And that My Sabbath is a day to rest from any earthly burdens, that they should prepare for themselves on the sixth day all their labors, that they not bring in nor take out from house to house on that day;

43. For Ha’Elohim kept the Sabbath holy and blessed it in the heavens before it was made known to any flesh upon the earth.

44. And this charge to keep the Sabbath I give unto my Israel alone; yea, to Israel alone do I give them to eat and drink and to keep my Sabbath upon the earth.

45. And I give them this charge: This mitzvahi and testimony should be given to thy children thy children's children forever, even unto the last generation;

46. And this that all the earth might know that Israel be my covenant peoples; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

chapter-aka: The Torah of YHVH

1. Behold, I make an everlasting covenant{a}; before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation;
[a] A covenant passed down from generation to generation

2. And all the people among thee shall see the work of YHVH{a}; for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
[a] See YHVH

3. Observe thou that which I instruct thee this day; behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite; I am YHVH, thy Elohim{a}.
[a] See Elohim

4. ¶ Thou shalt worship no other elohim{a}:
[a] See Elohim of man

5. For the Lord{a}, whose name is YHVH, is a jealous Elohim;
[a] Hebrew, Adonai; see Adonai

6. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee;

7. But thou shall destroy their altars, break their images{a}, and cut down their groves{b};
[a] Idols
[b] Literally "groups of trees," likely refers to the child sacrifices to idols where the children were burnt in fires; see 5 Moses 8:34-35, 19:2; Deuteronomy 12:29–31

8. Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring{a} after their elohim{b} and do sacrifice unto their gods{b}, and one call thee, and thou eat of their sacrifice,
[a] See 3 Moses 28:15; 4 Moses 3:37, 20:3-5, 37:12. 38:21; 5 Moses 1:41 Exodus 20:14, 2:23; Deuteronomy 5:18; Zenos 1:9
[b] See Elohim of man

9. And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their elohim{a} and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods{a}; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.
[a] See Elohim of man

10. ¶ Thou shalt make thee no molten elohim{a}:
[a] Idols; see Elohim of man

11. Nor shalt thou make unto thee elohim of wood, or of stone, or of any works by thy hand, or any elohim by the hands of men;

12. For this thing is detestable unto me, that thou should go a whoring after other gods; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

13. ¶ The Feast of Unleavened Bread{a} shalt thou keep:
[a] See Sabbath of Passover

14. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I instructed thee, in the time of the month thou camest out from Egypt; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

15. ¶ Thy first desire{a} that come unto thee from the womb is mine:
[a] As a carnal commandment, this was understood to be the first male of every living thing (Law of Moses); Kabbalah teaches that males represent our desire to bestow, and females our will to receive, the Law of Christ is to make God our first desire, and as we gain new desires, they too belong to God

16. All the firstborn of thy sons and thy daughters thou shalt redeem;

17. And every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male;

18. But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou redeem him not, then thou shalt set him loose:

19. And none shall appear before me empty handed; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

20. ¶ Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath{a}, thou shalt rest:
[a] See Sabbath of the Seventh Day

21. And even in the times of plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

22. ¶ And thou shalt observe Yom HaBikkurim{a}, the Feast of Weeks, which is the Feast of the Firstfruits of Wheat Harvest; and Chag HaAsif{b}, the Feast of Booths which is Sukkot, in the seventh month:
[a] See Sabbath of Yom HaBikkurim
[b] See Sabbath of Chag HaAsif

23. These shall be Sabbaths to thee, with the Passover{a}, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, that ye may gather as my Israel in remembrance,
[a] See Sabath of Passover

24. And this that the people should not forget their path in teshuvah{a} that they be my Israel{b}; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.
[a] See Teshuvah
[b] See Israel

25. ¶ Thrice in the year{a} shall all thy men children appear before me, the Lord YHVH, the Elohim of Israel:
[a] Three times in a year Israel is to gather before God: the Passover, and in the Feast of Weeks (Yom HaBikkurim), and in the Feast of Tabernacles (Chag HaAsif/Sukkot)

26. For I will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders;

27. Neither shall anyone desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before me, YHVH, thy Elohim, thrice in the year; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

28. ¶ Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven:

29. Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left unto the morning;

30. But there shall be none wasted, and all shall have their fill, that thou should rememberest all that I, YHVH, hath done for my Israel; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

31. ¶ The first of the firstfruits{a} of thy land thou shalt bring unto the my house, even the house of YHVH, thy Elohim:
[a] See 2 Nephi 1:76 RAV, 2:9a OPV; 1 Corinthians 15:20; James 1:18

32. And these shall be given to the Priests and the Priestesses, and they shall give to the poor, and those in need, that their wants and their needs should be met; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

33. ¶ Thou shalt not cook a kid in the milk of his mother{a}:
[a] Cooking of a kid in its mothers milk is both a statement against the cruelty towards animals, and avoiding the false traditions of Israel’s neighbors.

34. This thing is an abomination before me, for it mocketh the creation; therefore this thing is done in idolatry and priestcraft{a}, and is profane before my sight; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.
[a] See Priestcraft

35. ¶ And this is the eternal covenant that I make, between me and my Israel, see that thou keepst it that my people should be preserved upon the lands that I shall give them;

36. For when thou are obedient unto my covenant thou shall be blessed, and prosper in the land that I shall give unto thee, but when thou are not faithful then shall my wrath be poured out upon thee; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

1. And it came to pass that after YHVH{a} did give the Torah{b} of the Covenant unto Moses and Zipporah upon the Mount of Ha’Elohim, He spoke unto them again saying:
[a] See YHVH
[b] Hebrew, "Teachings," "Instructions," or "Law"

2. ¶ Thou shalt not blasphemy Ha’Elohim{a}, nor curse the ruler of thy people; turn not unto idols nor make to thyselves molten gods; I am YHVH, thy Elohim{b}.
[a] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim
[b] See Elohim

3. Thou shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither ear you up a standing image; neither shall thou set up any image of stone in your land to bow{a} down unto it; for I am YHVH, thy Elohim.
[a] This seems to be the point, art is not forbidden, but worshiping something made by the hands of man is forbidden; see Elohim of man

4. ¶ Thou shalt delight in blessing, and not in cursing{a}; and in the name of Ha’Elohim and of all the Holy Ones{b}, even all that are above thee, shalt thou bless; and it shall be a blessing.
[a] Hebrew masculine noun, "nakh’ash," meaning "divination," "prophesying against," "enchanting, or "cursing"
[b] Hebrew, "qaddish," meaning "Saints"

5. Thou shalt bless thy brethren and thy sistren, and thy children, and thy servants, and their children;

6. And all who seek to learn the righteousness of Elohim, and the peace of Israel, and all whom I, YHVH, hath committed to thy care; and they who blesseth thee, thou shalt honor.

7. ¶ If thou walk in my statutes, and keep my instructions, and do them, then I will give thee rain in due season; and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit;

8. And thy threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and thou shall eat thy bread to the full and dwell in thy lands safely.

9. And I will give peace in the land; and thou shall lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; and I will rid evil beasts out of the land; neither shall the sword go through your land.

10. And thou shall chase thy enemies, and they shall fall before thee by the sword.

11. And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

12. For I will have respect unto thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with thee.

13. And thou shall eat of the old store and will need to clean{a} out the old to make way for the new grains.
[a] An abundance of food

14. And I will set my Tabernacle{a} among thee; and my soul shall not abhor thee;
[a] See Tabernacle

15. And I will walk{a} among you and will be thy Elohim; and ye shall be my people.
[a] See 1 Moses 5:21, Genesis 3:8

16. I am YHVH, thy Elohim, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, that thou should not be their bondman; and I have broken the bands of thy yoke and made thee go upright.

17. ¶ But if thou will not hearken unto me and will not do all these instructions, and if thou shall despise my statutes,

18. Or if thy soul should abhor my judgments, so that thou will not do all my instructions, but that thou break my covenant, I also will do this unto thee:

19. I will even appoint over thee terror, consumption, and the sickness of chills and fever, that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart;

20. And thou shall sow thy seed in vain, for thy enemies shall devour thee and the fruits of the land in which thou should labor.

21. And I will set my face against thee, and thou shall be slain before thine enemies; they that hate thee shall reign over you; and thou shall flee when none pursueth you; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

22. ¶ And if thou will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish thee seven times more for thy sins;

23. And I will break the pride of thy power; and I will make thine heaven as iron and thine earth as brass;

24. And thy strength shall be spent in vain; for the land shall not yield her increase; neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

25. ¶ And if thou walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon thee according to thy sins.

26. I will also send wild beasts among thee, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy thy cattle, and make thee few in number; and your highways shall be desolate; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

27. ¶ And if thou will not be reformed{a} by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me, then will I also walk contrary unto thee and will punish thee yet seven times for thy sins.
[a] See Teshvah

28. And I will bring a sword upon thee that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant;

29. And when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and thou shall be delivered into the hand of the adversary.

30. And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven; and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight; and thou shall eat and not be satisfied.

31. And if thou will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me, then I will walk contrary unto thee also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise thee seven times for thy sins; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

32. ¶ And if thou shall turn{a} the hearts of the sons away from the hearts of the fathers, and hearts of the mothers away from the daughters then shall I come and smite the earth with a curse;
[a] See Malachi 4:3-6

33. And I will destroy your high places{a}, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.
[a] Places of worship; in Biblical times high places were both centers of worship to make sacrifices, burn incense, and hold feasts or festivals

34. And I will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation; and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.

35. And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

36. And I will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you; and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.

37. Then shall Eden{a} enjoy her Sabbaths{b}, as long as it lieth desolate and thou shall be in thine enemies' land; even then shall the land rest and enjoy her Sabbaths.
[a] A name for the Divine Feminine, the Creation, and the Earth; see Shekinah
[b] Hebrew, "rest"

38. And as long as Eden lieth desolate, it shall rest because it did not rest in your Sabbaths when thou dwelt upon it; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

39. ¶ And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies;

40. And the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth;

41. And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword when none pursueth; and thou shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

42. And thou shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

43. And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

44. ¶ But if thou shall confess thine iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me,

45. And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies, if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity,

46. Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember thy mother, Eden.

47. And the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her Sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them;

48. And they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity and this because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

49. And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away; neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them; for I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

50. But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their mothers and fathers, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their Elohim; I am YHVH.

51. ¶ And in all things that I have said unto thee, be circumspect and make no mention of the name of other gods{a}; neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
[a] See Elohim of man

52. Thou shalt not bow down to their elohim, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them.

53. And thou shall serve me, and I shall send Raphael{a} to bless thy bread and thy water; and I will take the plagues of sickness away from the midst of thee; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

6. ¶ They that sacrificeth unto any elohim{a}, save unto YHVH only, they shall no longer be counted as one of Israel;

15. Thou shall, therefore, put difference between the clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean;

16. And thou shall not make your souls abominable{a} by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

2. And if the thy have none to redeem it and they be able to redeem it, then let them count the years of the sale thereof and restore the surplus unto those to whom they sold it, that they may return unto their possession.

3. But if they be not able to restore it, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of they that hath bought it until the year of Jubilee{a}; and in the Jubilee it shall go out, and they shall return unto their possession; I am YHVH{b}, thy Elohim{c}.

4. ¶ And if a man sell his dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.

5. And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the Jubilee.

6. But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the Jubilee.

7. But the field of the suburbs{a} of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual{b} possession;
[a] The common land shared by the community
[b] Or "everlasting"

8. And know this: That all the land belongeth to YHVH for a possession, thou mayest buy and sell, but know thee that it is mine, and I give it to all of Israel as an inheritance; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

12. And if thy brother or sister that dwelleth by thee wax poor and be sold{a} unto thee, thou shalt not compel them to serve as a bondservant;
[a] As slaves or indentured servants

13. But as a hired servant and as a sojourner they shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee;

14. And then shall they depart from thee, both they and their children with them, and shall return unto their own family; and unto the possession of their fathers shall they return.

15. For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bondservants.

16. Thou shalt not rule over them with rigor, but shalt fear thy Elohim; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

17. ¶ Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids{a}, which thou shalt have, shall be of the nations that are round about you; of them shall thou might buy bondmen and bondmaids.
[a] Indentured servants; some may see these as slaves, but they are to be freed at the Jubilee, and are more like temporary help to be supported and cared for

18. Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them thou might purchase, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land; and they shall be as your brethren of Israel, thou shall not rule one over another with rigor.

19. And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell themselves unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family,

20. After that they are sold, they may be redeemed{a} again; one of their brethren may redeem them;
[a] Bought out from slavery

21. Either their uncle or the son of their uncle may redeem them; or any that is nigh of kin unto the of their family may redeem them; or if they be able, they may redeem themselves.

22. And they shall reckon with them that bought them, from the year that they were sold to them unto the year of Jubilee; and the price of their sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

23. If there be yet many years behind, according unto them, they shall give again the price of their redemption out of the money that they were bought for.

24. And if there remain but few years unto the year of Jubilee, then they shall count with them; and according unto their years shall they give them again the price of their redemption.

25. And as a yearly hired servant{a} shall they be with them; and the other shall not rule with rigor over them in thy sight.
[a] There are to be no slaves in Israel; see 4 Moses 45:9

26. And if they be redeemed not in these years, then they shall go out in the year of Jubilee, both they and their children with them.

27. For unto me, my children, Israel, are servants; they are my servants{a} whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

7. And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee.

8. I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate and the beast of the field multiply against thee;

9. By little and little{a} I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land.
[a] Indicating the YHVH had already set the stage for Israel to overtake the land of promise before they even left the Mount of Ha'Elohim

10. And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and thou shalt drive them out before thee.

11. ¶ And thou shalt make no covenant with the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite nor with their elohim{a};
[a] See Elohim of man

12. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods{a}, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

13. And thou shalt not seek not after thy own heart nor thy own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring{a} after the gods of the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
[a] YHVH sees the covenant with Israel as a type of marriage covenant; see Isaiah 54:5; Jeremiah 3:12-14, 20; Ezekiel 16:8- 14; Matthew 9:15; John 3:29; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Revelation 19:7-9

14. Thou shalt wear tzitzits{a} in the four corners of thy garments throughout all your generations, that thou shalt look upon it and remember all thy mitzvoth{b} and be holy unto thy Elohim; I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

chapter-aka: The Soul That Sins

1. And Moses and Zipporah spoke unto the congregation of Israel from out of the Tabernacle of the Congregation{a}, saying: If a soul{b} should sin, and hear the voice of swearing{c}, and is a witness, whether they hath seen or known of it, if they do not utter it, then they shall bear their iniquity.
[a] See Tabernacle
[b] See Soul
[c] Or "the Testimony from a witness"

2. Or if a soul toucheth any unclean{a} thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from them, they also shall be unclean.
[a] Something diseased, that can make people sick

3. Or, if they should touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a person shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from them, when they knoweth of it, then they shall be guilty.

4. Or if a soul swear{a}, saying with their lips to do evil or to do good, whatsoever it be that someone shall pronounce with an oath{a}, and it be hid from them, when they knoweth of it, then they shall be guilty in one of these.
[a] See 4 Moses 17

5. And it shall be that when they shall be guilty in one of these things, that they shall confess that they hath sinned in that thing;

6. And they shall bring their trespass offering unto YHVH{a} for their sin which they hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb, or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the Priest shall make an atonement for them concerning their sin.
[a] See YHVH

7. And if they are not able to bring a lamb, then they shall bring for their trespass, which they hath committed, two turtledoves or two young pigeons unto YHVH; one for a sin offering and the other for an offering.

8. And they shall bring them unto the Priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder;

9. And the Priest shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar; it is a sin offering.

10. And they shall offer the second for a meat offering, according to the manner; and the Priest shall make an atonement for them for their sin which they hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven them.

11. But if they be not able to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then they that sinned shall bring for their offering some fine flour for a sin offering;

12. And they shall put no oil upon it; neither shall they put any frankincense thereon, for it is a sin offering.

chapter-aka: The Chereb of Truth

1. And it came to pass that when Moses and Zipporah left Aaron upon the Mount of Ha’Elohim, the Voice{a} was heard from the heavens, and YHVH{b} spoke unto them, saying:
[a] See The Voice
[b] See YHVH

2. A swift messenger shall go out unto Adam{a}, and they who fulfill my Word will be my sons and my daughters{b}, and will carry the chereb of truth{c} which I give them,
[a] Hebrew, "mankind"
[b] Israel/Christians
[c] Hebrew "Chereb emeth," meaning "sword of truth," "tool of truth," "sword of faithfulness," or "tool of faithfulness;" see 2 Corinthians 6:7, Ephesians 6:17, Doctrine of the Saints 118g:5-8,

3. And this chereb is that my seers which have spoken from the foundation of the world, that thus will my Word be,

4. And if anyone is desirous of using this chereb{a}, by which the creation is revealed, and every miracle is performed, then speak to me, YHVH, thy Elohim{b}.
[a] Hebrew, feminine noun, "sword" or "tool"
[b] See Elohim

5. For in the beginning, in the name of Elohim Shaddai{a}, four were appointed:
[a] See Elohim Shaddai

6. Two were the angel of YHVH{a} and Raphael{b} who is Raziel{c} from before the foundation of the world,
[a] See Angel of YHVH
[b] Hebrew, "God has healed;" see Raphael
[c] Hebrew, "secret of God;" see Raphael

7. And one was Zadkiel{a} from the first day of creation, and one was Michael{b} from the second day of creation.
[a] Hebrew, "Tzadiqiel," "Righteousness of God" or Grace of God;" see Zadkiel
[b] Hebrew, "one who is like God;" see Michael

[a] See Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh
[b] Hebrew, "Teachings," "Instructions," or "Law."
[c] See Urim and Thummim

9. That by the Torah, and through these gazelem{a}, Adam{b} might see and be made to understand their role in the creation: preparing that which is below for that which is above, and bringing that which is above below that they are one{c}.
[a] See Gazelem
[b] Hebrew, "mankind"
[c] See Doctrines of the Saints 119:10

10. ¶ And with these four are five others, holy and strong; and these are their names:

11. And one is Ariel{a} from the third day of creation,
[a] Hebrew, "Lion of God;" see Ariel

12. And two are Haniel{a} from the fourth day of creation, and Moroni{b} from the fifth day of creation,
[a] Hebrew, "Joy of God," or "Grace of God;" see Haniel
[b] Arabic, "at the place of fire;" Moroni

13. And one is Gabriel{a} from the sixth day of creation,
[a] Hebrew, "Man of God;" see Gabriel

14. And one is Sandalphon{a} who is Remiel{b} from the seventh day of creation, even the Sabbath of YHVH.
[a] Hebrew "godfather;" see Sandalphon
[b] Hebrew, "thunder of God;" see Sandalphon

15. And these know and say: There is one more who YHVH hath set as the crown upon his head and that YHVH givieth the understanding of His heart, and he is Zaphkiel{a} who is Metatron{b} from before the foundation of the world;
[a] Hebrew, "God’s knowledge;" see Enoch
[b] Hebrew: "one who guards;" see Enoch

16. And unto these have been given power over everything that moveth upon the creation:

17. Yea, over these rest YHVH and under them rests the creation, and YHVH is Lord{a} over all.
[a] See Adonai

18. ¶ And when mankind{a} shall call upon YHVH, Ha’Elohim{b} shall send out one of these or the malakim{c}, one of the lords that stand under them,
[a] Hebrew, "Adam"
[b] See Ha'Elohim

[a] 4 Moses 7:23-26

8. One, thou shalt place the symbols upon it:

[a] Lamed would mean "goad" to Israelites of Lehi’s day

22. ¶ And now, to set apart a rod or a sword, or a cup, or any other item unto YHVH and use it to create the miracle and to glorify the name of YHVH, thou shalt follow these seven steps:

29. Six: upon the evening of the seventh day, when thou shall pray unto YHVH, a light shall descend upon thee:

38. And if they tell thee that thy rod, or sword, or cup, or other item is holy before YHVH, then ask them if they might place it in thy hand, and if they try but cannot, then they are iyrin{a} and thou shall begin again upon the next month;
[a] See Iyrin

39. But if they say unto thee: Nay, but it is holy, therefore the will of YHVH shall be done, then the rod is holy, and if thou should hold up thy rod, then call upon the winds, or the rain, or the hail, and they shall come.

40. And now, if thy rod, or sword, or cup, or other item be holy, then shalt thou watch over it, that it be not defiled.

1. When the prophet or the prophetess dance to hear the will of YHVH{a}, and the will of Ha’Elohim{b}, let the Priests or the Priestess praise YHVH in dance:
[a] See YHVH
[b] Hebrew, "the gods;"  see Ha'Elohim

2. Let them sing praises unto El Elyon{a} with the timbrel and harp; let the praises of Ha’Elohim be in their mouths.
[a] Hebrew, "the Most High God;" see El Elyon

3. And ye shall place the crown{a} upon the heads of the prophets and the prophetess; let the young men make music, and a joyful noise, and the young women dance in their praise;
[a] Hebrew, "Keter;" during the translation the term "cap" was presented in English, the image of a head covering worn by Elders in their Endowment, "Keter" was the term the Holy Spirit said to use

4. Let the eyes of the Elders be bright, that they might see, and YHVH shall speak unto Israel by the mouths of the prophets and the prophetesses, that the will of YHVH Elohim{a} should be made known.
[a] See YHVH Elohim

[a] The Holy Spirit; see The Voice

7. And the Presence{a} of God shall come upon the congregation, and Israel shall know Their words{b}; therefore, the sign or the wonder wheresoever they speak, surely it shall come to pass;
[a] See Shekinah
[b] The words of Ha'Elohim

8. Therefore, Israel shall walk after YHVH, their Elohim, and fear El Elyon, and keep the Torah{a}, and obey the Voice.

9. ¶ And the seer{a} shall see, and the dreamer of dreams shall be given a dream; and should their words be true to the Covenant, then their signs and wonders should surely come to pass;

2. YHVH, I beseech Thee that Thou will give me success in healing this one{a}, who is the son or daughter of them{a}.
[a] Replace "this one" and "them" with actual names

3. And when the Elders shall pray over the sick, placing olive oil{a} upon their heads, and YHVH, in His mercy, will send Raphael{b} to heal them.

[a] See Acts 19:11-12, Doctrines of the Saints 116:11-12

5. Do this and anyone for whom that should ask, whether thou do this in writing or by thy voice, they will be healed.

6. And if this faileth, then purify thyself from all thy sins and bathe{a} thy flesh first, and then seek the will of YHVH that thou should succeed,
[a] See Mikveh

7. And if it is not the will of YHVH, and if YHVH had said, in His great wisdom, not{a} to send Raphael, then they will not be healed,
[a] See Doctrines of the Saints 4a:55-56

8. Then YHVH, in His mercy, shall send Mal’akh Ha’Mavet{a}, and he shall take them, and this is the will of Ha’Elohim{b}; and so must it be; Amen.

[a] See So mote it be

12. And when the spirit hath gotten up into that pot, it shall gurgle that thou should know;

[a] See Mark 5:8-10
[b] Matthew 17:18, Acts 16:18

15. ¶ And should thy enemies come before thee, thou mayest send the angels of the wrath of Ha’Elohim against them, be they thy creditor, or thy enemy, or armies, or any that should desire to do thee harm;

16. And these should they do, if it be the will of YHVH: punish them, or the sinking of their ships, or the breaking of their walls, or the damage to their business;

17. Or to exile them, or to place a plague upon them or upon their households, or to bind them or to blind them, or to make them mute, or to make them lame, or to do anything that would grieve them;

18. But know that if thou should do this and thou art worthy of the same then I{a} shall put that thing back against thee.
[a] Angel of YHVH

19. Take thee fresh water from the stream and pour them into seven pots that have never tasted a flame; set these before Ha’Elohim at the night, that the stars should watch over them;

20. And upon the seventh night, thou shalt pour the water out, speaking the name of thy enemies, and break the pots, and scatter the shards to the East, and to the North, and to the West, and to the South;

21. Then thou shall say: YHVH, by thy power, bind them{a}, smite them that the light of Thy eyes shall not look upon them,
[a] Replace "them" with their actual names

22. Make their mouth stop, that mine enemy should not bind or harm me in any way, but that which they should wish upon me should be done unto them;

23. Make their plans against me be in vain, that they should not trespass against me, but that their trespass should be taken and turned against them;

24. And should they be worthy in their anger against me, and should they be more worthy than myself, then should their plannings come to pass, and all that I wish against them should be done unto me; So mote it be, Amen.

25. Do this, and that harm which thou desirest against thy enemy should be done unto them; but should thou not say: all that I wish against them should be done unto me; then shall Ha’Elohim know thy vanities, and YHVH shall bring thee low, even seven fold.

26. And should thou pray for plenty or for famine, for the rain to be plenty or sparse, or whether there will be locusts come and strife, or whether the sword should come or peace;

27. Know, O man, that the will of YHVH shall be done in all things; therefore, seek first the will of Ha’Elohim, then doest thou this and it will be well for thee and for thy house.

28. ¶ Take thee a new vessel for drinking{a} and fill it with oil mixed with the sweet smelling myrrh and thou comest out from the bridal chamber{b}, throw it into{c} the sun;
[a] Or "a new cup"
[b] Or "the mourning after having sex with your spouse"
[c] Or "towards"

29. Do this for three days in a row and thy season shall be fruitful; there shall be fruits plenty, and no locus{a} shall come upon thee.
[a] It is unclear if this refers to fertility or just having a good year

30. ¶ Take thee the sweat of thy brow, and the sweat of brow of thy wife, and put these into an unpolluted cup with an amount of fine oil, and write upon it your names when the shofar hath blown for the full moon{a},
[a] Rosh Chodesh

31. And bless it, giving it as a sacrifice unto YHVH; then shall thou bury it under thy doorstep and dig it up after the shofar hath been sounded for the next new moon;

32. And when ye shall wear it, both the husband and the wife, your passion{a} shall be remembered, and your flames shall grow bright and hot.
[a] Or "love"

33. ¶ To call forth the malakim{a} of YHVH that they might serve thee in wisdom in knowledge{b}, bless a new vial filled with oil and honey, and call upon them by name, as a servant of YHVH;
[a] See Malak
[b] Or "answer your questions"

34. If the malak cometh not the first time, call again the next day, and this thou should do until the third day;

35. And if the malak that thou doth call upon cometh not upon the third day, open the vial and see that the oil and honey hath become polluted, and the malak shall not come.

36. And if the malak should come, then see that thou not be deceived, asking to embrace the malak, even as thou would a brother that hath returned home;

37. And if the malak sayeth yea, then he be a deceiver and is not of YHVH and shall pass through thee, for this is the iyrin{a} that fell in disgrace;
[a] See Iyrin

38. And if the malak sayeth nay, then ask thy question; and when thou hath asked thy questions, pour out the vial and prostrate thyself upon the earth and praise YHVH that the malak should not take{a} thee.
[a] Implying that the angel might kill the one that summoned them

39. ¶ And should thou need to cross the waters on dry ground{a}, or to tap the rock that water should spring{b} fourth, then make thee an amulet, and upon it write: Chereb{c};

5. ¶ And Moses spoke unto Zipporah, his wife, saying: Who shall we find that possesses all these that I should go to them?

6. And Moses asked in his heart, and thought that there could be no man or woman who would do all this that YHVH had asked; and this weighed heavy upon him.

7. And Zipporah spoke unto Moses, saying: YHVH hath called thee to be His mighty right arm, and did give of us His glory and His crown{a}, with an oath:
[a] See 4 Moses 37:5

chapter-aka: The Testimony of Zipporah

1. And it came to pass that I walked{a} with Moses upon the Mount of Ha’Elohim, and there we heard the words of the Angel of YHVH{b} that came unto us, saying: Your crowns{c} have been prepared; therefore, give unto YHVH{d} your trust, for ye hath gained His patience.
[a] See 3 Moses 27:22
[b] See Angel of YHVH
[c] Hebrew, "Keter"
[d] See YHVH

2. And Moses, in his humility, said: Lord{a}, why should thou take us? who are we to make supplication{b} with Ha’Elohim{c} for thy son and thy daughter, Adam{d}?
[a] Moses is speaking to the angel of YHVH; see Adonai
[b] Hebrew "athar;" "to pray" or "to supplicate."
[c] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim
[d] Hebrew: "mankind"

3. And the angel of YHVH said: Make not any of thy supplication with me, but the will of Ha’Elohim shall be done.

4. And Moses said: We will not cease to plead with YHVH, our Elohim{a}.
[a] See Elohim

5. And the Voice{a} said: Your crowns have been prepared you; therefore come forth that ye mayst obtain them.
[a] See The Voice

6. Then Moses said: O YHVH, O Elohim Shaddai{a} ! O YHVH who birthed the Creation! Listen to me, we have pleaded much for thy children, Israel;
[a] Hebrew, "God(s) Almighty," or "the Almighty God(s)"

7. And we will bring them thy Torah{a}, that they should remember HaShem{b}, that thou might give them a blessing from the heavens;
[a] Hebrew, "Teachings," "Instructions," or Law"
[b] Hebrew, "The Name;" see HaShem

8. For thou didst bless Joseph; and by Joseph his father, Jacob; and his brothers, and their wives, and their children; yea and even did YHVH save all of Israel from famine.

9. And the Voice came unto us, saying: Moses, my beloved, all things whatever thou should ask shall I give to my Israel.

10. ¶ And it came to pass that we were brought before YHVH, and we were given{a} the Torah, that all of Israel might covenant to be one.
[a] See 3 Moses 29:26-34

11. And so it was that we were given the Torah of YHVH that Israel should be the covenant people, and be one with her Elohim.

12. ¶ And it came to pass that when we came down from the Mount and saw Israel, the very children of YHVH that we had pleaded for, and on behalf of, prostrate in adultery{a}, Moses became enraged, and he threw down the tablets{b} in disgust.
[a] See 3 Moses 30:25
[b] See 3 Moses 30:26

13. But YHVH, in His mercy, called us back, and we pleaded once more on behalf of Israel, and YHVH granted our petition;

14. And YHVH spoke unto us saying: Teach my Israel my Torah, that they be my covenant people;

15. But because they be a stiffnecked people, it shall be that when they shall keep my mitzvath{a}, they shall be blessed upon the face of this land,
[a] Hebrew: "tradition," "commandment," or "obligation"

16. And there shall be none to molest them nor to take away from them the land of their inheritance; and they shall be a blessed people upon the promised land forever.

17. And nothing, save it shall be iniquity among them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever.

18. But if iniquity shall abound, cursed shall be the land for their sakes; but unto the righteous, it shall be blessed forever; So mote it be, Amen.

1. And it came to pass that Zipporah and Miriam taught the daughters of Israel saying:

2. The Sabbaths{a} are known by the stars in the heavens, and by the moons; and these tell us the seasons{b} and the secrets of Ha’Elohim{c};
[a] Hebrew, "rest." See 4 Moses 2
[b] See Genesis 1:14
[c] See Ha'Elohim

3. For YHVH{a} has appointed the moon for seasons; and YHVH telleth the sun when to rise and when to set.
[a] See YHVH

4. And the Sons of Aaron shall be bound by the tabernacles and chained to the altars, and the Daughters of Miriam shall read words{a} written upon the night skies;
[a] A form of astrology, see 4 Moses 2:16, 39:1-19; Genesis 1:14

5. And in the day of our gladness, and in our solemn days, and in the beginnings of our months— at the new moons{a}, the Priests shall blow the shofar, and give the offerings and the sacrifices of our peace offerings,
[a] Rosh Chodesh: The beginning of every new Hebrew month, based on the fist sighting of a new moon

6. And this they do for a memorial before our Elohim{a}; YHVH, our Elohim; the Priests, they do cry out with their shofars, as Yod{b} searching for Hei{c}.
[a] See Elohim
[b] Representing The Creator or the Divine Masculine (Heavenly Father)
[c] Representing the revelation, the Divine Feminine (Heavenly Mother, the Shekinah)

7. And at the full moons the Priestess sing and dance in celebration of the return of the Shekinah{a} to Her place, and the Presence of Elohim in the congregation of Israel;
[a] See Shekinah

8. Therefore, it is the duty of the  Priestess to watch the moon and the stars, and to tell the signs and the seasons.

9. ¶ And YHVH did create both the day and the night, even as he created Adam{a}, male and female; and the shemesh{b} for the male, and the lebanah{c} for the female.
[a] Hebrew, "mankind"
[b] Hebrew, "sun," also representing the west and the masculine
[c] Hebrew, "moon," also representing the north and the feminine

10. And on the first of the month, not one daughter in Israel shall do any spinning, nor weaving, nor sewing; for this shall be a Sabbath{a} for you.
[a] Hebrew, "rest"

11. And at the new moons, and at the full moons the High Priestess shall pour out her libations{a} as a sacrifice unto YHVH;
[a] Hebrew, "to pour," or "to pour out;" see Libations

12. And in this the Presence of Elohim{a} shall be remembered, and the congregation shall witness the Breath of Elohim{b}.
[a] See Shekinah
[b] See Ruach HaKodesh

13. ¶ And so it is that in the evening we raise our arms to YHVH and Ha’Elohim in the heavens and we pray:

14. Hear O Israel! YHVH is our Elohim; YHVH is United.

15. And this we do, because we are united even as the stars in the night sky.

16. And we stand and we bow our faces in reverence in the morning, even as the sun rises, and we pray:

17. Hear O Israel! YHVH is our Elohim; YHVH is One.

18. And this we do because YHVH is the Light,{a} and in Him there is no darkness;
[a] See 1 John 1:5

19. Even as Israel walked out of Egypt as one, it is the will of Ha’Elohim that Israel always be one; for in the unity of Israel is great power in YHVH; and the fear of YHVH will be known by His Israel.

20. ¶ And the unity of YHVH and His Israel is even as the bridegroom{a} and the bride,
[a] See Isaiah 61:10; Matthew 25:1-13; Doctrines of the Saints 2h:6, 15f:1, 38c:13-15, 118g:15

21. And should Israel love YHVH, even as a wife should love her husband and commit no adultery{a}, then shall YHVH be faithful unto His Israel forever and ever;
[a] Hebrew masculine noun, usually refers to a man having sex or a sexual relationship with a married woman; also used to describe the worship of idols as God views our relationship/ covenant with Him as a marriage covenant

22. And should Israel be unfaithful, then she shall be offered teshuvah{a}, that she might return unto the covenant, and retain all her promises once more. Even so, Amen.
[a] Hebrew, "return." Christ is the way back to God, usually translated as "repentance," "grace," or "redemption"

[b] Likely fermented wine, but unclear; could be any fermented drink, including beer

9. ¶ And in thy homes, at Tu Kesheh{a}, should thy husband desire to lie with thee, that ye should be one, keep the strength of thy passions{b}, that it might be used to destroy familiar spirits, and to stop thy adversaries, and to free one from mortal burdens, to pass through water upon dry ground, or any other thing:
[a] The celebration of the Full Moons; see Tu Kesheh
[b] A type of ritual where the woman collects the sexual energy in a bowl

11. And on the third day that after thou hast lain with thy husband, when thou riseth, wash thy hands and say the prayer of thy desire; so mote it be{a}, Amen.
[a] Hebrew, "verily," "truth," or "truly;" see So mote it be, Amen

12. Then shalt thou pour out thy libation upon the ground, and YHVH that doth hear thy prayers shall grant thee thy petition;

13. But should the water sour, or should it be drunk{a} at all during this time, behold thy petition shall neither be heard nor remembered by YHVH, for it is in vain.

chapter-aka: The Judgments of the Clean and the Unclean

1. And it came to pass that Moses passed judgment on Israel saying:

2. These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth:

3. Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat;

4. Nevertheless, ye shall not eat the camel because he is a servant unto thee, and bears thy burdens; thus ye shall not eat of it;

5. And the swine, is unclean{a} to you, for in his meat is sickness and death; therefore of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
[a] Something that can make a person sick

6. These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.

7. And ye shall not eat the eagle, nor the peres{a}, nor the rachamah{b}, nor the vulture, nor the daah{c} after his kind, nor raven after his kind, nor the owl;
[a] bearded vulture or ossifrage; an unknown or extinct animal
[b] Maybe a carrion vulture
[c] A bird of prey, maybe the kite

8. Not the nighthawk, nor the cuckoo, nor the hawk after his kind, nor the little owl, nor the cormorant and the great owl, nor the stork, nor the heron after her kind, and the dukiphath{a}, nor the bat ye shall not eat:
[a] Maybe a hoopoe

9. And these ye shall not eat, for these are scavengers or eat that which would plague thee, thus ye shall keep them alive.

10. ¶ And these may ye eat of: Every flying, creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;

11. Even these of them ye may eat: The locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

12. ¶ And if ye should eat of that which is unclean, ye shall be unclean{a} and shall quarantine{b} for thirty days; but whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening, but shall cover the mouth{c} that Israel may know they are unclean;
[a] Something that can make a person sick
[b] A period or place of isolation in which people that have been exposed to an infectious or contagious animal or disease are placed; see 4 Moses 47:42
[c] One must cover their mouth when they are potentially sick to fulfill two laws: respect for elderly (4 Moses 13:4, 1 Peter 5:4) and general care for the vulnerable (4 Moses 12:10-12, James 1:27)

13. And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash their clothes and be unclean until the evening.

14. ¶ The carcasses{a} of every beast ye shall deplore; and they that beareth the carcass of the beast shall wash their clothes and be unclean for three days, until the even; they are unclean unto you.
[a] Implying that the skin is worn to take the essence of the animal upon themselves

15. ¶ And upon whatsoever anything doth fall when they are dead, it shall be unclean, whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, or earthen vessel; whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done;

16. And the vessel must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; so it shall be cleansed.

17. All meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.

18. And everything whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether it be an oven or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down; for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.

19. Nevertheless, a fountain or pit wherein there is plenty of flowing water shall be clean; but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.

20. ¶ And if any part of their carcass falls upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

21. But if any water be put upon the seed and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

22. And if any beast of which ye may eat die, they that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the evening.

23. ¶ And this shall be the Torah{a} of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth—
[a] Hebrew, "Teachings," "Instructions," or "Law"

24. To keep the unclean from the clean, that Israel should avoid the plagues of Ha’Elohim{a}.

chapter-aka: The Judgments on Servants, Masters and Marriages
1. And it came to pass that Moses passed judgment on Israel saying:

2. If thou buy a Hebrew servant (for Israel shall have no slaves, YHVH hath not freed us to put our kin into bondage), six years they shall serve; and in the seventh they shall go out free for nothing.

3. And if they came in by themselves, then they shall go out by themselves; if they be married, then the spouse of them shall go out with them.

4. If the lord hath given them a spouse, and these have borne sons or daughters, then they and all their children shall go out together.

5. And if the servant shall say plainly: I love my master; my spouse and our children, we shall not go out free{a}, then the master shall bring them unto the judges;
[a] Or leave servitude

6. And the judges shall set their wages, that they be fair and generous; and they shall serve their lord for so long as their wages be met.

7. ¶ And if a man should sell{a} his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do, that she not be forced to prostitute herself.
[a] An indentured servant, or a concubine

8. If she please not her master, who hath promised to keep her to himself{a}, then shall he let her be given to another:
[a] Like a wife, but not as a wife; a concubine

9. But ye shall not sell her into a strange nation; no one shall have no power to do this, seeing they hath dealt deceitfully{a} with her, that she not be cast out of the Covenant.
[a] Selling a woman to a foreign nation could cause the woman to be placed into prostitution, a violation of vs 7

10. And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner{a} of daughters.
[a] He cannot have her as a wife or a concubine; see 3 Moses 55:12, 36-37; 4 Moses 13:21

11. And if a man should take her unto himself to wife, and he take him another{a} wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.
[a] See polygamy

12. And if she refuseth these three unto her, then shall she go out free with a dowry{a}.
[a] Money and gifts given freely to help the new marriage, and to help in the bearing of children

13. ¶ If a man entice a young woman that is not betrothed and lie with her, but doth not force himself upon her, then he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

14. If her father utterly refuseth to give her unto him, he shall pay money{a} according to the dowry of virgins{b}.
[a] Money given to the family to be used to the daughter's dowery
[b] The man that sleapt with her but is not marrying her will now pay her dowry

15. ¶ If a man takest a wife, thou shalt take such a one as thou lovest, and who loveth thee, and whom thou mayest lawfully marry and thou shalt go before the High Priest, or the Chief Elder where thou dwellest, or the Priest;

16. And by him shall ye be joined in marriage, that these may be one in life, and in life everlasting; and that the fruit of thy loins might be with thee everlasting; and ye shall be united; and ye shall give one another thy honor.

17. ¶ If the wife of any man should go aside and commit a trespass against him, and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witnesses against her, neither she be taken with the manner,

18. And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be with child, or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not with child,

19. Then shall the man bring his wife unto the Priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, a part of barley meal; and the Priest shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon, for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

20. And the Priest shall bring her unto the Priestess and set the wife before YHVH;

21. And the Priestess shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the Priestess shall take and put it into the water;

22. And the Priestess shall set the wife before YHVH, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering{a}; and the Priestess shall have in her hand the bitter water that causeth the curse.
[a] A type of spell or procedure used to cause a woman to abort her child if she cheated on her husband

23. And the Priestess shall charge her by an oath and say unto the wife: If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse;

24. But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband,

25. YHVH make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when YHVH doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;

26. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot.

27. And the wife shall say: So Mote it Be; Amen{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "verily," "truth," or "truly;" see So mote it be, Amen

28. And the Priestess shall write these curses in a book, and she shall blot them out with the bitter water;

29. And she shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.

30. Then the Priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before YHVH, and offer it upon the altar;

31. And the Priestess shall take a handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.

32. And when the Priestess hath made the wife to drink the water, then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter{a}, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot; and the woman shall be a curse{b} among her people.
[a] Cause an abortion
[b] She will need to repent of adultry

33. And if the wife be not defiled but be clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive seed{a}.
[a] The fetus does not abort

34. And if another man has lain with her, then that man shall be found dead in his bed the next morning; and this shall be a sign unto you of his sin.

35. This is the Torah{a} of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband and is defiled,
[a] Hebrew, "Teachings," "Instructions," or "Law"

36. Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife and shall set the woman before YHVH, and the Priestess of Miriam shall execute upon her all this law.

37. And if the curse{a} should not be found in the wife, and she be innocent, then the husband shall be guilty;
[a] Adultery

38. And he shall offer up a sacrifice a sin offering{a} unto YHVH by way of the Priest, and he shall ask his wife for forgiveness for his trespass against her.

11. If they rise again and walk abroad upon their staff, then shall they that smote them be quit; only they shall pay for the loss of their time and shall cause them to be thoroughly healed.

12. ¶ And if a man or a woman should smite their servant or their maid with a rod and they die under their hand, they shall surely be put to death.

13. Notwithstanding, if they continue a day or two and recover, they shall not be put to death, for they are the servant, but their wages shall be paid{a} as though they were fit in their duties.
[a] This is a form of financial compensation

14. And if a man or a woman smite the eye of their servant or the eye of their maid, that it perish, they shall let them go free with their wages{a} for the sake of the eye.
[a] Implying lifelong financial compensation for the injured party

15. And if a man or a woman smite out their servant's tooth, they shall let them go free with their wages{a} for the tooth's sake.

16. ¶ If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall not be accountable.

18. If there be laid on the owner of the ox a sum of money, then they shall give for the ransom of their life whatsoever is laid upon them.

19. Whether the ox gored a son or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done.

20. ¶ And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein, then the owner of the pit shall make it good and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be theirs.

21. And if an ox hurt another ox, that he die, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide;

22. Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in, he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

23. ¶ If a man or a woman shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it or sell it, they shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.

24. If fire should break out and catch in thorns so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field be consumed therewith, they that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

chapter-aka: The Judgment of the Plague of Tzara’at

1. If anyone should have in the skin of their flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of their flesh like the plague of tzara’at{a}, then they shall be brought unto the Priest or the Priestess;
[a] See tzara’at

2. When the plague is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the Priest; and when the plague is in a woman, then she shall be brought unto the Priestess;

3. And the Priest or Priestess shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh; and when the hair in the plague is turned white and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of their flesh, it is a plague of tzara’at; and the Priest or Priestess shall look on them and pronounce them unclean{a}.
[a] Normally something that can make a person sick, here someone who has sinned

4. If the bright spot be white in the skin of their flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the Priest or Priestess shall shut them up in quarantine{a} thy that hath the plague seven days;
[a] a period or place

5. And the Priest or Priestess shall look on them the seventh day; and behold, if the plague in their sight be at a stay and the plague hath spread not in the skin, then the Priest or Priestess shall shut them up seven days more;

6. And the Priest or Priestess shall look on them again the seventh day; and behold, if the plague be somewhat dark and the plague spread not in the skin, the Priest or Priestess shall pronounce them clean{a}; it is but a rash or a scab or a boil; and they shall wash their clothes and be clean.
[a] Or "whole"

7. But if the rash spread much abroad in the skin after they hath been seen of the Priest or Priestess for their cleansing, they shall be seen of the Priest or Priestess again;

8. And if the Priest or Priestess see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the Priest or Priestess shall pronounce them unclean; it is tzara’at.

9. When the plague of tzara’at is in someone, then they shall be brought unto the High Priest or High Priestess{a};
[a] It is implied that a man would see a High Priest and a woman a High Priestess, 4 Moses see 47:2 of isolation in which people that have been exposed to an infectious or contagious animal or disease are placed; see 4 Moses 47:42

10. And the High Priest or High Priestess shall see them; and behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick, raw flesh in the rising, it is a chronic disease in the skin of their flesh;

11. And the High Priest or High Priestess shall pronounce them unclean and shall not shut them up; for they are unclean.

12. ¶ And if a tzara’at break out abroad in the skin and the tzara’at cover all the skin of they that hath the plague, from their head even to their foot, wheresoever the High Priest or High Priestess looketh,

13. Then the High Priest or High Priestess shall consider; and behold, if the tzara’at have covered all their flesh, they shall pronounce them clean that hath the plague; it is all turned white; they are clean.

14. But when raw flesh appeareth in them, they shall be unclean:

15. And the Priest or Priestess shall see the raw flesh and pronounce them to be unclean; for the raw flesh is unclean; it is tzara’at.

16. Or if the raw flesh turn again and be changed unto white, they shall come unto the Priest or Priestess;

17. And the Priest or Priestess shall see them; and behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the Priest or Priestess shall pronounce them clean that hath the plague; they are clean.

18. The flesh also in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil and is healed, and in the place of the boil there be a white rising or a bright spot, white and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the Priest or Priestess,

19. And if, when the Priest or Priestess seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin and the hair thereof be turned white, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is a plague of tzara’at broken out of the boil.

20. But if the Priest or Priestess look on it and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark, then the Priest or Priestess shall shut them up{a} seven days;
[a] Quarantine

21. And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the Priest or Priestess shall pronounce them unclean; it is a plague.

22. ¶ If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard, then the Priest or Priestess shall see the plague;

23. And behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin and there be in it a yellow thin hair, then the Priest or Priestess shall pronounce them unclean; it is an outbreak, even tzara’at upon the head or beard.

24. And if the Priest or Priestess look on the plague and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it, then the Priest or Priestess shall shut them up that hath the plague seven days;

25. And in the seventh day the Priest or Priestess shall look on the plague; and behold, if the outbreak spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the outbreak be not in sight deeper than the skin, they shall be shaven;

26. But the outbreak shall they not shave; and the Priest or Priestess shall shut them up{a} that hath the outbreak seven days more.
[a] Quarantine

27. And in the seventh day the Priest or Priestess shall look on the outbreak;

28. And behold, if the outbreak be not spread in the skin nor be in sight deeper than the skin, then the Priest or Priestess shall pronounce them clean{a}; and they shall wash their clothes{b} and be clean.
[a] Or "whole"
[b] It is unclear if the washing of the clothing is symbolic as a ritual or needed to stop the spread of disease, it may be both

29. But if the outbreak spread much in the skin after their cleansing, then the Priest or Priestess shall look on them;

30. And behold, if the outbreak be spread in the skin, the Priest or Priestess shall not seek for yellow hair; they are unclean.

31. But if the outbreak be in their sight at a stay{a} and that there is black hair grown up therein, the outbreak is healed; they are clean, and the Priest or Priestess shall pronounce them clean.
[a] The growth is stopped

32. ¶ If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots{a}, even white bright spots, then the Priest and Priestess shall look;
[a] White swellings or scabs

33. And behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white, it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; they are clean.

34. ¶ And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet he is clean.

35. And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald; yet he is clean.

36. And if there be in the bald head or bald forehead a white reddish sore, it is a tzara’at{a} sprung up in his bald head or his bald forehead.
[a] A crippling disease that reduced people to a state of paralysis

37. Then the Priest shall look upon it; and behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head or in his bald forehead, as the tzara’at appeareth in the skin of the flesh, he or she is unclean; the Priest shall pronounce them utterly unclean; their plague is in their head.

38. ¶ And the tzara’at in whom the plague is, their clothes shall be rent, and their head bare, and they shall put a covering upon their mouth{a}, and shall cry: Unclean, unclean.
[a] to cover the mouth when one is potentially sick fulfills two laws; respect for elderly, see 4 Moses 13:4, 1 Peter 5:4, and general care for the vulnerable, see 4 Moses 12:10-12, James 1:27

39. All the days wherein the plague shall be in them they shall be defiled; they are unclean; they shall dwell alone; without the camp shall their habitation be.

40. ¶ The garment also that the plague of tzara’at is in, whether it be a woolen garment or a linen garment, whether it be in the warp or woof{a}, of linen or of woolen, whether in a skin{b} or in anything made of skin,
[a] The foundation of any structure from weaving, in which the warp, threads that run lengthwise, and the woof, threads that run across, make up fabric
[b] See Alma 1:03-104 RAV, 35-6 OPV

41. And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is a plague of tzara’at and shall be showed unto the Priest or the Priestess.

42. And the Priest or Priestess shall look upon the plague and shut up it that hath the plague seven days;

43. And they shall look on the plague on the seventh day; if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin, the plague is a fretting tzara’at; it is unclean.

44. They shall, therefore, burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or anything of skin wherein the plague is; for it is a fretting tzara’at; it shall be burnt in the fire.

45. And if the Priest or Priestess shall look and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, then the Priest or Priestess shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and they shall be shut up seven days more;

46. And the Priest or Priestess shall look on the plague after that it is washed; and behold, if the plague has not changed its color and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.

47. And if the Priest or Priestess look and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it, then they shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof;

48. And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is a spreading plague; thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

49. And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time and shall be clean.

50. ¶ This is the Torah{a} of the plague of tzara’at in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or anything of skins, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.
[a] Hebrew, Teachings, Instructions, or Law

51. These are the instructions and the judgments which YHVH commanded, by the hand of Moses, unto Israel.
