2. Even the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;

3. And when YHVH, thy Elohim, shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them;

4. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughters thou shalt not give unto their sons, nor their daughters shalt thou take unto thy sons;

5. For they will turn away thy sons from following thy Elohim, that they may serve other elohim{a}; so will the anger of YHVH be kindled against you and destroy thee suddenly.
[a] See Elohim of man

6. But thus shall you deal with them: You shall destroy their{a} altars, and tear down their sacred pillars, and burn their wooden idols, and smash their images carved into stone;
[a] There are many similarities between the worship and rituals of Israel and their neighbors, it is who they worship that makes their rituals holy

7. For thou art a holy people unto YHVH, thy Elohim; YHVH, thy Elohim, hath chosen thee to be a holy people unto Himself, prized above all peoples upon the face of the earth.

8. YHVH did not set His love upon you nor choose you because you are more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people;

9. But YHVH loves you and because He would keep the oath which He had sworn unto your fathers,

10. And for the sake of that oath hath YHVH brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

11. Know, therefore, that YHVH, thy Elohim, He is El Elyon{a} above all of Ha’Elohim{b}, the faithful God{c}, which keepeth covenants and hath mercy for they that love Him and keep His mitzvoth{d} to a thousand generations,

[b] Hebrew: "the Gods;" see Ha'Elohim
[c] Hebrew, "El"
[d] Hebrew; calling, commandment, or religious duty

[a] Or "keep"

14. ¶ Wherefore, it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these customs{a} and keep and do them, that YHVH, thy Elohim, shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which He swore unto thy fathers;

15. And YHVH will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee;

16. YHVH will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy herds, and the flocks of thy sheep in the land which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee;

17. And thou shalt be blessed above all people; there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle.

18. And YHVH shall take away from thee the plagues{a}, yea, none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will fall upon thee, but these shall be set aside to curse them that hate thee.
[a] See 3 Moses 8-18

19. And thou shalt consume all the people which YHVH, thy Elohim, shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve their elohim, for that will be a snare unto thee.

20. And if thou shalt say in thine heart: These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?

21. Thou shalt not be afraid of them but shalt well remember what YHVH, thy Elohim, did unto Pharaoh and unto all of Egypt:

22. The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and His mighty right arm{a}, and His outstretched arm whereby YHVH, thy Elohim, brought thee out; so shall YHVH, thy Elohim, do unto all the people of whom thou might surly fear.
[a] Or right hand, likely a reference to Jesus

23. Moreover, YHVH, thy Elohim, will send the hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed;

24. Therefore, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for YHVH, thy Elohim, is among you, and is the highest and the most revered amongst Ha’Elohim.

25. ¶ And YHVH, thy Elohim, will put out those nations before thee by little and little; thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

26. But YHVH, thy Elohim, shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed.

27. And YHVH shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their names from under the heavens;

28. And there shall be no one able to stand before thee; thou conquer them all.

29. The graven images of their elohim{a} shall you burn with fire; thou shalt not covet the silver or gold that is in them nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is loathsome unto YHVH, thy Elohim;
[a] See Elohim of man

30. Neither shalt thou bring any such detestable things into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it; but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed{a} thing.

10. A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

11. And when thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless YHVH, thy Elohim, for the good land which thou hath been given.

12. ¶ Beware: forget not YHVH, thy Elohim, falling asleep to His mitzvoth, and His practice, and His ordinances, which I lay charge upon thee this day,

13. Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein,

14. And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied,

15. Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget YHVH, thy Elohim, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage,

16. Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water, who brought thee forth water out of the rock{a} of flint,
[a] See 3 Moses 24:7-8, 50:13; Exodus 17:5-7; Numbers 20:10-11

17. Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna{a}, which thy fathers knew not, that He might humble thee and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter{b} end.
[a] See 3 Moses 22
[b] Or "at the very end"

18. ¶ And thou might say in thine heart: My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth;

19. But thou shalt remember YHVH, thy Elohim; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He swore unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

20. ¶ And it shall come to pass that if thou do at all forget YHVH, thy Elohim, and walk after other elohim{a}, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.
[a] See Elohim of man

21. As the nations which YHVH conquereth before your face, so shall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of YHVH, your Elohim; therefore, remember, and perish not.

chapter-aka: Hear, O Israel

1. Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,

2. A people great and tall, the children of giants{a}, whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say{b}: Who can stand before the children of giants?
[a] In Numbers 13:22, 28, & 33; and Deuteronomy 9:2, they are called the "children of Anak," who is supposed to have been a giant, and a father of races of giants; not to be confused with nephilim from 1 Moses 10:11
[b] See 3 Moses 46:28

3. Understand, therefore, this day that YHVH{a}, thy Elohim{b}, shall go over before thee; as a consuming fire shall destroy them, and shall bring them down before thy face;
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

4. And by this shalt thou drive them out and conquer them quickly, even as YHVH hath said.

5. ¶ Speak not in thine heart after YHVH, thy Elohim, hath cast them out from before thee, saying: For my righteousness YHVH hath brought me in to possess this land; but for the wickedness of these nations YHVH doth drive them out from before thee.

6. Not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart dost thou go to possess their land;

7. But for the wickedness of these nations YHVH, thy Elohim, doth drive them out from before thee, and that He may perform the Word which YHVH swore unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

8. ¶ Understand, therefore, that YHVH, thy Elohim, giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiff-necked people.

9. Remember and forget not how thou provokedst YHVH, thy Elohim, to wrath in the wilderness;

10. Yea, from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt until you came unto this place you have been rebellious against YHVH.

11. You did provok YHVH to wrath, so that at times YHVH was angry enough to have utterly wiped thee out.

12. When I was gone up into the Mount{a} to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the Covenant which YHVH did make with you, there we abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; we neither did eat bread nor drink water;
[a] See 3 Moses 29-30

13. And YHVH delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of YHVH;

14. And on them was written according to all the words which YHVH spoke in the mount, out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

15. And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that YHVH gave us the two tables of stone, even the Tables of the Covenant.

16. ¶ And it came to pass that YHVH said{a} unto us: Arise; get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves;
[a] 3 Moses 30:9

17. They are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.

18. Furthermore, YHVH spoke unto us, saying: I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

19. Let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.

20. ¶ And it came to pass that I turned and came down from the Mount, and the Mount burned with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.

21. And I looked, and behold, ye had sinned against YHVH, your Elohim, and had made you a molten calf; you had turned aside quickly out of the way which YHVH had commanded you.

22. And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.

23. And I fell down before YHVH, as at the first, forty days and forty nights;

24. I did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sins which you sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of YHVH, to provoke Him to anger;

25. For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith YHVH was wroth against you to destroy you. but YHVH hearkened unto me at that time also.

26. And YHVH was very angry with Aaron, to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

27. And it came to pass that I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust;

28. And I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the Mount.

29. ¶ Likewise, it came to pass{a} that when YHVH sent you, saying: Go up and possess the land which I have given you;
[a] See 3 Moses 46

30. Then ye rebelled against the commandment of YHVH, your Elohim, and you believed Him not nor hearkened to His voice.

31. Yea, you have been rebellious against YHVH from the day that I knew you.

32. Thus I fell down before YHVH forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first, because YHVH had said He would destroy you.

33. I prayed, therefore, unto YHVH and said: O Lord{a} YHVH, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
[a] Adonai, Hebrew, "Lord;" Its root is "shalam" meaning "to be of domineering, and in a master, or rabreban, which means "lord" or "noble." complete" or "sound;" Not to be confused with "adon," "mare," or gebir which also mean "Lord," but in the sense

34. Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin{a},
[a] See Sin

35. Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say: Because YHVH was not able to bring them into the land which He promised them and because He hated them, He hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness;

36. Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by Thy mighty power and by Thy mighty right hand and Thy outstretched arm.

[a] See YHVH
[b] See 3 Moses 32-33

2. And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou breakest, save the words of the Everlasting Covenant{a} of the Holy Priesthood; and thou shalt put them in the ark.
[a] See Everlasting covenant

3. And I made an ark of wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the Mount of Ha’Elohim, having the two tables in mine hand.

4. And YHVH wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the Covenant, which YHVH spoke unto you in the Mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly;

5. And He gave ten instructions also; and YHVH gave these unto us, that thou might know, and that thou wouldst remember.

6. And we turned ourselves, and came down from the Mount, and I put the tables in the ark which had been made; and there they be even as YHVH commanded me.

7. ¶ And it came to pass that Israel took her journey from there to the mount where Aaron died{a}, and there he was buried; and Eleazar, his son, ministered in the office of the Priest in his stead.
[a] See 3 Moses 50

8. And YHVH separated the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant of YHVH, to stand before YHVH to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name;

9. And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and YHVH hearkened unto me at that time also, and YHVH would not destroy thee.

10. And YHVH said unto me: Arise; take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them.

11. ¶ And now, O Israel, what doth YHVH, thy Elohim{a}, require of thee, but to reverence YHVH, thy Elohim,
[a] See Elohim

12. To walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve YHVH, thy Elohim, with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

13. To keep the mizvath{a} of YHVH and His ordinances{b} which I instruct thee this day for thy good?
[a] Hebrew, calling, commandment, or religious duty

15. Only YHVH had a delight in thy fathers to love them; and He chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.

16. Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of thine heart and be no more stiff-necked;

17. For YHVH, your Elohim, is Elohim over Ha’Elohim{a}, and Lord{b} of lords{c}, El Elyon{d}, mighty and awesome, which regardeth not any persons nor taketh any bribes;

19. For YHVH hath said{a}: If a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, thou shall not vex them; but the stranger that dwelleth with thee shall be unto thee as one born among you,
[a] See 4 Moses 12:8-9

20. And thou shalt love them as thyself; for thou wast a stranger in the land of Egypt; and I am YHVH, thy Elohim.

21. Therefore, love the stranger and the foreigner amongst you; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

22. ¶ Thou shalt fear YHVH, thy Elohim; Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou cleave and make all thy oaths by His name.

23. He is thy praise, and He is thy Elohim, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen.

24. Thy fathers went down into Egypt with but seventy{a} people; and now YHVH, thy Elohim, hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude;
[a] See 3 Moses 1:8

[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim
[c] Mighty right arm: A name for Moses, see 4 Moses 36:8.
[d] Outstretched arm: A name for Zipporah. 

2. And His miracles, and His acts, which He did in the midst of Egypt{a} unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and unto all his land,
[a] See 3 Moss 8-19, Exodus 5-13

3. And what He did{a} unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how YHVH did destroy them,
[a] See 3 Moses 20, Exodus 14

4. And what He did unto you in the wilderness until ye came into this place,

5. And what he did{a} unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, which said: We will not come up;
[a] See 3 Moses 48

6. And how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel.

7. But your eyes have seen all the great acts of YHVH which He did;

8. Therefore, you shall keep all the mitzvoth{a} which I give you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land whither you go to possess it,
[a] Hebrew, calling, commandment, or religious duty

9. And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which YHVH swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey;

10. For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt from whence you came out, where thou sowed thy seed and watered it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;

11. But the land whither you go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water of the rain of the heavens.

12. Yea, it is a land which YHVH, thy Elohim, careth for; the eyes of YHVH, thy Elohim, are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

13. ¶ And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently unto my mitzvoth which I command you this day, to love YHVH, your Elohim, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,

14. That YHVH will give you the rain of your land in His due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

15. And YHVH will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.

16. Take heed to yourselves, therefore, that your heart be not deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other elohim{a}, and worship them;
[a] See Elohim of man

17. And then the wrath of YHVH shall be kindled against you and He shall shut up the heavens, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit, and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which YHVH giveth you;

18. Therefore, you shall lay up these, my words, in your heart and in your soul, and bind{a} them for a sign{b} upon your hand, that they may be as a vision{c} between your eyes:
[a] To make secure by our actions
[b] "Token," or "pledge"
[c] Referring to one's perspective

19. And you shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

20. And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts{a} of thine house and upon thy gates,
[a] See Mezuzah

21. That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which YHVH swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens upon the earth.

22. ¶ And if you shall diligently keep all these mitzvoth which I teach unto you, to do them—to love YHVH, our Elohim, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave unto Him—

23. Then will YHVH drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall possess greater nations and a people mightier than yourselves.

24. Yea, the very place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours; from the wilderness, from the river, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

25. And no one shall be able to stand before you; for YHVH, your Elohim, shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon, even as He hath said unto you.

26. ¶ Behold, I set before you this day a blessing{a} and a curse:
[a] See 1 Nephi 1:54-58 RAV, 2:20-24 OPV; 2 Nephi 1:34b RAV, 1:30 OPV; Alma 7:15-16 RAV, 9:13 OPV

27. A blessing that if you obey the mitzvoth of YHVH, your Elohim, which I do teach you this day,

28. And a curse if you will not obey the mitzvoth of YHVH, your Elohim, but turn aside out of the way which I teach you this day, to go after other elohim{a} which you have not known.
[a] See Elohim of man

29. ¶ And it shall come to pass that when YHVH, thy Elohim, hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put a blessing upon the mountain{a} to the North of that land, and the curse upon the tallest mountain to the North{b}, residing next to that blessed mount.
[a] Likely Mount Gerizim
[b] Likely Mount Ebal

30. And the mountain to the North, it is blessed, and it shall be as the Mountain of Ha’Elohim unto you, for it is the place where thy father, Abraham went to offer up his son, our father, Isaac unto YHVH; and there the angel of YHVH{a} did meet him.
[a] See Angel of YHVH

31. And thou shalt build an altar on that cursed mountain, that which is the tallest mountain to the North, made from cut stones, to make there the peace offerings{a} upon that altar,
[a] See 4 Moses 28

32. And you shall eat there, and you shall write the words of this Law on the stone;

33. And this shall be as a tabernacle{a} unto YHVH, that Ha’Elohim will see and remember, that the curse of this mountain come not upon you.
[a] Or "temple"

34. For you shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which YHVH, your Elohim, giveth you, and ye shall possess it and dwell therein;

35. And you shall observe to do all the statutes and ordinances which I set before you this day; even so, Amen.

1. And these are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land, which YHVH{a}, the Elohim{b} of thy fathers giveth thee to possess, all the days that ye live upon the earth:
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

2. Ye shall do away and blot out all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their elohim{a}, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree;
[a] See Elohim of man

3. Ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their obelisks{a}, and burn their idols of wood with fire; and carved images of their elohim{b} ye shall break, and destroy the names of them out of that place.
[a] a stone pillar set up as a monument or landmark
[b] See Elohim of man

4. And ye shall not worship YHVH, your Elohim, in these ways;

5. But unto the place which YHVH, your Elohim, shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, even unto His habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;

6. And thither ye shall bring your offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks;

7. And there ye shall eat before YHVH, your Elohim, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein YHVH, thy Elohim, hath blessed thee.

8. ¶ Ye shall no more do after all the things that we do here this day, everyone doing whatsoever is right in their own eyes;

9. For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which YHVH, your Elohim, giveth you:

10. But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which YHVH, your Elohim, giveth you to inherit, and when He giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety,

11. Then there shall be a place which YHVH, your Elohim, shall choose to cause His name to dwell there.

12. And there ye shall bring all that I command you: your offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and offerings, and all your choice votive offerings which ye vow unto YHVH;

13. And ye shall rejoice before YHVH, your Elohim; ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

14. Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest;

15. But in the places in which YHVH shall choose, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I instruct thee.

16. Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of YHVH, thy Elohim, which He hath given thee;

17. The unclean and the clean beasts thou may eat{a} thereof, only thou shall not eat the blood; yea, thou shall pour it upon the earth as water.
[a] Indicating that eating the unclean animals is not a spiritual law or a sin; see Deuteronomy 12:15, Matthew 15:10-11

18. ¶ Thou mayest not eat within thy gates thy tithes of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy offerings which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or votive offering of thine hand;

19. But thou must eat them before YHVH, thy Elohim, in the place which YHVH, thy Elohim, shall choose,

20. Thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates;

21. And thou shalt rejoice before YHVH, thy Elohim, in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.

22. ¶ Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth:

23. When YHVH, thy Elohim, shall enlarge thy border, as He hath promised thee, and thou shalt say: I will eat meat; thou mayest eat meat, whenever thou should desire it.

24. If the place which YHVH, thy Elohim, hath chosen to put His name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which YHVH hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thou should desire; the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike:

25. Only be sure that thou eat not the blood; for the blood is the life, and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh; thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water;

26. Thou shalt not eat it, that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of YHVH.

27. Only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt take and go unto the place which YHVH shall choose;

28. And thou shalt offer thy offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altars of YHVH, thy Elohim;

29. And the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altars of YHVH, thy Elohim, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

30. Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee forever when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of YHVH, thy Elohim.

31. ¶ When YHVH, thy Elohim, shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their land,

32. Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them after that they be converted{a} from before thee,
[a] Hebrew, "shub;" the idea of coming back or returning; dual meaning, one of the Hebrews in the promised land returning to YHVH, and Israel returning to apostasy and idol worship

33. And that thou inquire not after their elohim{a}, saying: How did these nations serve their elohim? Even so will I do likewise.
[a] See Elohim of man

34. Thou shalt not do so unto YHVH, thy Elohim; for every abomination{a} to YHVH which He hateth have they done unto their gods{b};
[a] See 5 Moses 8:35
[b] See Elohim of man

35. For even their sons and their daughters they have burnt as offerings in the fire to their elohim.

36. ¶ What thing soever I instruct you, observe to do it; thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it.

5. ¶ Remember that YHVH, thy Elohim, spoke by the power and authority of His own name, and this because there is none greater:

chapter-aka: Hearken unto the Voice of YHVH

1. If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and they giveth thee a sign or a miracle, and the sign or the miracle come to pass,

2. But they say unto thee: Let us go after other elohim{a} which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams;
[a] See Elohim of man

3. For YHVH{a}, thy Elohim{b}, proveth thee, to know whether thou love YHVH, your Elohim, with all thy heart{c} and with all thy soul:
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim
[c] See Heart

4. Ye shall walk after YHVH, your Elohim, and love Him, and keep His mitzvoth{a}, and obey His Voice{b}; and thou shall serve YHVH and cleave unto Him.
[a] Hebrew, calling, commandment, or religious duty
[b] See The Voice

5. And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be turned away because they hath spoken priestcraft{a} to turn you away from YHVH, your Elohim, which brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which YHVH, thy Elohim, instructed thee to walk in:
[a] Hebrew, "kesheph;" masculine noun, "sorcery;" see Doctrines of the Saints 106:5-35, Book of Remembrance 9:25-26

6. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

7. ¶ If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying: Let us go and serve other elohim, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers,

8. Namely, the elohim of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth,

9. Thou shalt not consent unto them nor hearken unto them; neither shall thine eye pity them; neither shalt thou spare them; neither shalt thou conceal them;

10. But thou shalt surely turn them away; thine hand shall be first upon them to put to death that priestcraft, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

11. And thou shalt cast them out of thy residence{a}, that should they die, it be the will of Ha’Elohim{b};
[a] See Matthew 10:14, 12:43-45
[b] Hebrew, "the gods;" see Ha'Elohim

12. For they hath sought to thrust thee away from YHVH, thy Elohim, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage.

13. And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this among you.

14. ¶ If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which YHVH, thy Elohim, hath given thee to dwell there, saying:

15. Scoundrels are gone out from among you, and have led astray the inhabitants of their city, saying: Let us go and serve other elohim, which thou hast not known,

16. Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and behold, if it be truth and the thing certain, that such a detestable thing is wrought among you,

17. Thou shalt surely teach these, thy people, to follow YHVH, thy Elohim, that they be offered teshuvah{a};
[a] Hebrew, "return," Christ is the way back to God; usually translated as "grace," "repentance," or "redemption"

18. And if they reject YHVH, and should draw their swords against thee and thy peoples, then shall thou smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword,

19. And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof and shalt burn with fire, all the spoil thereof, every whit, for an offering unto YHVH, thy Elohim.

20. And thou shall keep none of the cursed things into thine hand, that YHVH may turn from the fierceness of His anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee as He hath sworn unto thy fathers,

21. For when thou shalt hearken unto the Voice of YHVH, thy Elohim, to keep all His mitzvoth which I do instruct thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of YHVH, thy Elohim, thou shalt be blessed;

22. Therefore, thou shalt delight in blessing, and not in cursing.

23. And in the name of YHVH, and of all the holy ones{a}, even all that are above thee, shalt thou bless; and it shall be a blessing.
[a] See Ha'Elohim

24. And thou shalt bless thy fellows, and thy children and servants, and theirs; and all who seek to learn the righteousness of YHVH, and the peace of His Kingdom of thee, and all they whom Ha’Elohim{a} hath committed to thy care:
[a] See Ha'Elohim

25. And they who do bless thee, these shalt thou honor.

26. ¶ Thou shalt not curse out of the bitterness of thine own heart; nor shalt thou curse any but they that is under condemnation of the Torah{a} of YHVH, and being oft rebuked, will not seek teshuvah.
[a] Hebrew, "Law," "Instructions," or "Teachings"

27. Thou shalt not curse thy neighbors, nor the stranger that dwelleth with thee; for the hand of the judge be over them, and should they rebuke, they will repent{a}, and turn to righteousness;
[a] See Teshuvah

28. But should should these bind thee with curses, then shalt thou do likewise that thou should seek the protection of YHVH.

29. But thou shalt not curse any who is placed in authority, or that hath been given dominion over thee;

30. And if these should oppress thee, or do thee unrighteousness, and thy cry ascend to YHVH in heaven, in heaven will He hear thee and will be thy avenger;

31. Therefore, curse not, lest thy curse return upon thee.

chapter-aka: The Clean and the Unclean

1. To keep sickness from this people, thou shalt not eat any sickly{a} or detestable{b} thing.
[a] Hebrew, "chalah;" weak, sickly, or sick
[b] Hebrew, "shiqquts;" " abominable idols," "detestable idol," or "detestable things;" food sacrificed or made for/ given too other gods

2. And these are the beasts which thou shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,

3. The deer, and the gazelle, and the roe deer, and the aqqo, and the antelope, and the wild ox, and the wild goat;

4. And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that thou shall eat.

5. Nevertheless, these thou shall not eat: of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the cloven hoof, as the camel, and the hare, and the coney; for they chew the cud but divide not the hoof; therefore, they are unclean{a} unto thee.
[a] Hebrew, "tame;" unclean typically refers to anything that can make people sick, mostly physically but sometimes spiritually—this seems to be more of a health code than spiritual law; see 5 Moses 8:17, Deuteronomy 12:15, Matthew 15:10-11

6. And the swine, because it divideth the hoof yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you; thou shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their dead carcass.

7. ¶ These thou shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales thou shall eat; and whatsoever hath not fins and scales thou may not eat; it is unclean unto thee.

8. Of all clean birds thou shall eat, but these are they of which thou shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

9. And the glede, and the vulture, and the bird of prey; and every raven after his kind, and the bath, the tachmas, and the gull, and any kind of hawk, and the kowc{a}, and the yanshuph, and the tinshemeth,
[a] A type of owl

10. And the stork, and the heron, and the dukiphath, and the bat; but of all clean fowls thou may eat.

11. And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto thee; they shall not be eaten.

12. ¶ Thou shall not eat of anything that dieth on its own; thou shalt not give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that they may eat it; nor may thou sell it unto a foreigner.

13. And all this thou shall do to abate the sickness that should come should thou eateth that which is unclean;

14. For as I commanded thee: thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thou should desire; the unclean and the clean, thou shall eat of them alike;

15. But of the unclean, these thou shall not bring into the place YHVH shall choose to place His name, nor shall thou give of it unto YHVH as a sacrifice.

16. ¶ Thou shalt not sacrifice unto YHVH, thy Elohim, any bullock or sheep wherein there is blemish or any that is mangled; for that is detestable unto YHVH, thy Elohim.

17. And because thou art a holy people unto YHVH, thy Elohim, thou shalt not eat of the blood, nor shall thou cook a kid in the milk of its mother.

18. ¶ Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year,

19. And thou shalt eat before YHVH, thy Elohim, in the place which He shall choose to place His name there,

20. The tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks, that thou mayest learn to revere YHVH, thy Elohim, always.

21. And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, or if the place be too far from thee which YHVH, thy Elohim, shall choose to set His name there when YHVH, thy Elohim, hath blessed thee,

22. Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which YHVH, thy Elohim, shall choose;

23. And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul should desire, be it oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth;

24. And thou shalt eat it as a feast before YHVH, thy Elohim, and thou shalt rejoice, thee and thine household,

25. ¶ And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake them, for they hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

26. At the end of three years, thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year and shalt lay it up within thy gates;

27. And the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow which are within thy gates shall come, and shall eat, and be satisfied,

28. That YHVH, thy Elohim, may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.

29. ¶ All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto YHVH, thy Elohim; thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.

30. Thou shalt eat it before YHVH, thy Elohim, year by year in the place which YHVH shall choose, thou and thy household.

31. And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto YHVH, thy Elohim.

32. And thou shalt eat it within thy gates; the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as if it were a gazelle or deer.

33. Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.

[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim
[c] See Ha'Elohim

2. Nevertheless, in the assembly thou shalt speak with a flowing voice, that they who prayeth with thee might hear, and may say: So mote it be{a}; Amen.
[a] See So mote it be

3. Thy prayers shall be unto YHVH, thy Father; for He is rich in mercy and loving kindness;

4. And in the Heavens shall He hear thee, in the fullness of His Wisdom{a} and goodness, as thou believeth on His name;
[a] Chokhmah, a play on words, another term for Shekinah, God the Mother; see Shekinah

5. But unto the Priests of YHVH thou shall petition for whatsoever He has dispensed unto them; for the mercy of YHVH is over all His works.

6. ¶ And when in blessing, YHVH, thy Elohim, shall bestow upon thee any great and choice blessing; or, in His abundant charity, shall deliver thee from any great calamity, thou shalt assemble together thy wives, and thy children; thy friends, and thy neighbors; and shalt celebrate his glorious goodness with thank offerings, and feasting, and music, and dancing.

7. And for the chief blessings of YHVH to thee, shalt thou keep it in remembrance from year to year, and teach it to thy children, that they who inherit the blessing may not forget gratitude to the giver, and the remembrance of the goodness of thy Elohim be preserved throughout all generations.

8. ¶ Thou shalt offer upon the altar of YHVH, thy Elohim, and before the Priests, sacrifices for sin offerings, and for trespass offerings, and for memorials, and for peace offerings, and for thank offerings.

9. Thy offerings shall be of the firstlings of thy flocks, and of the choice of thy fields, and of the chief{a} of all holy things.
[a] Or "best of"

10. Of thy flocks thou shall offer the firstling of male or female, without deformity or blemish, of such as divide the hoof and chew the cud;

11. And of fowls, shalt thou offer all singing birds; and of fishes, all that have scales and fins; and of shell fish, such as have two shells, and move about from place to place:

12. And these shall be holy unto YHVH, thy Elohim, and shall be offered upon the altar.

13. Of the choice of thy fields, that which is good for food without change or addition, and whatsoever is used for bread for mankind, that is holy unto YHVH, thy Elohim, and shall be offered unto Him as an offering, and lifted up to the Priest; but it shall not be offered on the altar.

14. And whatsoever other thing you offer, it shall be accompanied with one of these, and thus thy gift shall be sanctified:

15. But if it be not accompanied with one of these, thou shalt redeem it at the valuation of the Priest, and it and the price thereof shall belong to YHVH.

16. ¶ And when YHVH, thy Elohim, shall manifest Himself unto thee in majesty and might, or walketh with thee, and revealeth unto thee wisdom{a} and knowledge{b}, thou shalt erect pillars, tablets and enduring monuments unto Him, and make inscriptions upon them:
[a] A play on words, as this is Chokhmah, another term for Shekinah, God the Mother
[b] A play on words, as this is Da’at and can represent God the Father

17. And thou shalt write and inscribe thereon the dealings of YHVH with thee, His blessings and mercies, and His great power and glory, which YHVH hath revealed unto thee;

18. And this that it may remain a witness to the generations to come; and that they may know that YHVH is thy Elohim and there is none else.

19. Thou shalt preserve the memory of the chosen of YHVH, who have been faithful in their duties, and in whatsoever YHVH, thy Elohim, hath called them, teaching their deeds unto thy children, and thy children’s children.

20. Thou shalt build monuments to their memory, and erect pillars and tablets, and inscribe their praises, their works, their faith and their sufferings thereon;

21. And when thou beholdest their monuments, thou shalt remember them, and talk of their righteousness, and teach thy children to walk in their righteous ways.

22. But remember, you are the children of YHVH, your Elohim; thou shall not cut{a} thyself nor make any baldness{b} between thy eyes for the dead;
[a] Shedding one’s own blood to appease gods
[b] Done to gain favor from or for their dead

23. For it is unclean{a}, and you art a holy people unto YHVH, thy Elohim; and YHVH hath chosen you to be a peculiar people unto Himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.
[a] See Unclean

24. And when YHVH shall give thee a victory over thy enemies, thou shalt commemorate it with monuments and inscriptions;

25. But over the graves of persecutors and blasphemers, and they who shed the blood of the innocent, and at the places of their abominations shalt thou pile rough stones, with muttered curses, against the day of the resurrection of damnation;

26. And thou shalt teach thy children to add a stone to the pile as they pass by, and to curse any that remove the stones, and cleaves unto their wickedness.

chapter-aka: The Release of YHVH

1. At the end of every seven{a} years thou shalt make a release, and this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth unto their neighbor shall release it;
[a] See 4 Moses 11

2. They shall not exact it of their neighbor or of their brother because it is called the release of YHVH.

3. Of the foreigner thou mayest exact it again; but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release, save when there shall be no poor among you;

4. For YHVH{a}, thy Elohim{b}, shall greatly bless thee in the land which He giveth thee for an inheritance, to possess it, only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of YHVH, thy Elohim, to observe to do all these mitzvah which I instruct thee this day;
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

5. For YHVH, thy Elohim, hath blessed thee, as He promised thee; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.

6. ¶ And if there be among you a poor Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman within any of thy gates in thy land which YHVH, thy Elohim, giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother or sister;

7. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto them and shalt surely gift them sufficient for their need, in that which they wanteth.

8. Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying: The seventh year, the year of Jubilee{a}, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother or sister, and thou givest them naught;
[a] See 4 Moses 11

9. And then these should cry unto YHVH against thee, for it would be sin unto thee.

10. Yea, thou shalt surely give them, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto them, and for this thing YHVH, thy Elohim, shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto;

11. For the poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore, I command thee, saying: Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brothers and sisters, to thy poor, and to thy needy in thy land.

12. ¶ And if a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman be sold{a} unto thee and serve thee six years, then in the seventh year thou shalt let them go free from thee.
[a] This appears to be more on an indentured servant than a slave

13. And when thou sendest them out free from thee, thou shalt not let them go away empty handed;

14. Thou shalt furnish them liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress; of that wherewith YHVH, thy Elohim, hath blessed thee, thou shalt give unto them.

15. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt, and that YHVH, thy Elohim, redeemed thee; therefore, I instruct thee this thing today.

16. And it shall be, if they say unto thee: I will not go away from thee, because they loveth thee and thine house, because they are well with thee,

17. Then thou shall go before thy judge, and set their wages, that they may stay with thee and thy house, and it shall be a generous wage.

18. And if the wage set be greater than thou canst bear, it shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest them away free from thee;

19. For they have been worth double the hired servant to thee in serving thee six years; and YHVH, thy Elohim, shall bless thee in all that thou doest.

20. ¶ This is the Torah{a} of the servant taken captive in war, and of the servant bought with money, and of the servant born in thy house, and of him who cleaveth unto thee that thou mayest be a ruler unto them:
[a] Hebrew, "Law," "Instructions," or "Teachings" 

21. Behold, these shall be unto thee next to thy child; and thou shalt seek to establish them; for their greatness is thy glory.

22. And if they be content to abide in thy household, thou shall appoint them their food, their raiment, and their habitation, in due season;

23. And they shall labor in thy shop, and in they field, and with thy flock; therefore, they shall share in all thy toils, and in all thy possessions, and thou shall be as a ruler over them.

24. And should they serve thee, thou shall not cast them off forever; but if thou wouldst oppress them, and they flee from thee, no one shall not return them to thee, lest thy hand be hard upon them.

25. ¶ Behold, this Torah doeth not justify slavery; servitude is voluntary, and every servant in thy house may depart from oppression, at their will.

26. And if thy brethren or the neighbors of a ruler should join themselves unto them, they shall appoint unto them duty and reward, according to their rank, and ability, and faithfulness:

27. Yea, in their household they shall be as sons and daughter; and with him, and with his heir, shall possess his inheritance, that they together, being strong, may wax exceedingly great.

1. Observe the first month, and keep the Passover{a} unto YHVH{b}, thy Elohim{c}; for in the first{d} month YHVH, thy Elohim, brought thee forth out of Egypt{e} by night;
[a] See The Feast of Unleavened Bread
[b] See YHVH
[c] See Elohim
[d] The first month on the Hebrew calendar is Abib, see Abib
[e] See Egypt

2. Thou shalt, therefore, sacrifice the Passover unto YHVH, thy Elohim, of the flock and the herd, in the place where YHVH shall choose to place His name there.

3. Thou shalt eat no leavened{a} bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
[a] Leaven here is seen as a symbol of sin, Israel had to flee so quickly that they did not even have time for their bread to rise; see 3 Moses 18:11, Exodus 12:39

4. And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy lands for seven days; neither shall any of the flesh which thou sacrifice the first day remain until the morning.

5. Thou shall offer the sacrifice of the Passover at the place which YHVH, thy Elohim, shall choose to place His name in,

6. There thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at the evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt,

7. And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which YHVH, thy Elohim, shall choose; and thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents.

8. Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to YHVH, thy Elohim; thou shalt do no work therein.

9. Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn,

10. And thou shalt keep the Yom HaBikkurim{a} unto YHVH, thy Elohim, with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto YHVH, thy Elohim, according as YHVH, thy Elohim, hath blessed thee;
[a] See The Sabbath of Yom HaBikkurim

11. And thou shalt rejoice before YHVH, thy Elohim, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow that are among you, in the place which YHVH, thy Elohim, hath chosen to place His name there.

12. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman{a} in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
[a] Or "slave"

13. ¶ Thou shalt observe Chag HaAsif{a} seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine;
[a] Sukkot; See the Sabbath of Chag HaAsif

14. And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow that are within thy gates.

15. Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto YHVH, thy Elohim, in the place which YHVH shall choose;

16. And this because YHVH, thy Elohim, shall bless thee in all thine increase and in all the works of thine hands; therefore, thou shalt surely rejoice.

[a] The local place of worship, temple or synagogue

21. And thou shalt come unto the Priests, the Levites, and unto these thou shall inquire; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment;

18. Yet the king shall have all these to defend his people, and the children of his people, but never to oppress them.

19. ¶ The king shall not multiply to himself wives{a}; lest he forget the Torah, and avenge not his people, and lest his heart turn from them to strange women.
[a] See 5 Moses 16:4, 1 Kings 11:4-11

20. Neither shall he multiply to himself servants of the children of his people; lest his yoke be oppressive.

[a] See 5 Moses 16:4 

22. Neither shall he lead his people to strange places to dwell therein, which YHVH, thy Elohim, hath not appointed for their dwelling; lest they depart from the Torah, and despise it.

23. The king shall not make other laws, despising this; but all his laws and commandments{a} shall be according to the Torah of YHVH, thy Elohim, to establish it;
[a] Or "instructions"

24. For whatsoever YHVH, thy Elohim, shall speak, the king shall decree, and YHVH shall alter it as seemeth good unto Him, and none shall hinder.

30. Each member of the council shall keep the charge which the king should give unto them, in their several duties and shall be a faithful steward of whatsoever in Israel shall be rendered unto them, with a just account of their stewardship.

31. And the counselors of the king shall be chosen by him as seemeth him good, being just men and women, learned in the Torah, not proud, nor haughty; not given to much babbling.

32. And they shall keep the secrets of the king all the days of their lives; and if they serve the king well, they shall be rewarded;

33. But if they are unfaithful, they shall be frowned upon, and he may choose new counselors, as seemeth him good.

34. ¶ And the king shall appoint wise men and women, learned in the Torah of YHVH, lovers of righteousness, not fearing the rich, nor despising the poor, to be judges; who shall sit before him continually, to judge all great causes.

35. These shall sit upon the judgment seat of the king, and the ear of the judges shall never be closed, that they cannot hear; this is the court of the king.

36. And the king may appoint twelve judges to this court, if so many are needed; all of these shall be loyal to El Elyon{a}; for the judging of all matters greatly;
[a] "The Most High God;" see El Elyon

37. But all the smaller matters may be judged by other judges, as the king shall appoint, that these may judge the larger causes continually, and that they judge upon the judgment of other judges.

38. And the king shall order and determine what causes shall come before the court of the king, upon his judgment seat to be judged, and what causes shall be judged before the other judgment seats.

39. And the judges shall hear and judge, and determine speedily, they shall not delay; and they shall judge righteous judgment, and shall not take them any bribes or gifts, nor shall they do any injustice.

40. And if these judges should judge unrighteously, or refuse judgment to the just, or despise the Torah, or receive any bribes, they shall be removed.

41. When they have served faithfully, they shall be relieved from their duties in their age and infirmity{a}.
[a] Or "in their old age"

42. These men shall execute all the orders of the judge, and shall be a fear unto the disorderly, and all revilers; yea, they shall do whatsoever the judges command{a}.
[a] Or "instruct"

43. And the chief among them shall be the steward{a} of the substance of the king, which he committeth to the judges, and shall render a just account of his stewardship to the king.

13. All those who receiveth an inheritance shall preserve a forest thereon, that their children may walk in the shade thereof, and may build houses and prepare food;

1. The Priests, the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the offerings of YHVH{a} made by fire and his inheritance;
[a] See YHVH

2. Therefore, they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; for YHVH is their inheritance, even as He hath said{a} unto them.
[a] See 4 Moses 19; 5 Moses 8:13

3. And this shall be the due from the people to the Priests, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep:

4. And they shall give unto the Priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

5. The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give unto them;

6. For YHVH, thy Elohim{a}, hath chosen them out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the name of YHVH, him and his sons forever{b}.
[a] See Elohim
[b] See Doctrines of the Saints 117

7. And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which YHVH shall choose,

8. Then he shall minister in the name of YHVH, his Elohim, as all his brethren, the Levites, do which stand there before YHVH.

9. They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony{a}.
[a] An estate or property by ancient endowment

10. ¶ And all the fruit of thy fields, and the increase of thy flocks, a tenth{a} shall you render to the house of YHVH, thy Elohim;
[a] Ten percent is the maximum tithe, anything over this is an offering

11. And this that the Priest who administers in holy things may eat bread, and that the land might yield her increase.

12. For should thou do not these things, the Priest shall fail to instruct thy and thy children;

13. And the order of the house where YHVH should dwell shall be forgotten and righteousness shall cease;

14. Then shall wickedness be in the midst of thee, and oppression come upon thee.

15. ¶ Moreover, YHVH shall send enemies into the lands, and these shall exact that which thou hath withheld from Him, and shall wrest it from you with increase; and if thou should resist them, thou shall be destroyed;

16. Therefore, all of the spoil which Israel should take from her enemies, a tenth shall be rendered to the Priests of YHVH, thy Elohim,

17. That they who administer in holy things may remember thee before YHVH, and that YHVH might deliver thee:

18. And should thou do not this, ye shall not go fourth with a blessing, and shall flee before thy enemies, and none shall deliver thee.

19. ¶ And they that labor not in these things, these shall give one tenth of their time, consecrated unto YHVH, thy Elohim, and shall labor on behalf of the Priest, according to thy skill, and thy cunning, and thy art, and you shall not withhold;

20. That the place of YHVH among you may not be wanting, and not fail, and that thou might possess abundantly fields, flocks, and habitations:

21. For should thou do not these things, thou shall not prosper in the work of thy hands, and poverty shall be in thy dwellings;

22. Moreover, the robbers shall take thy goods and substance from Israel, to recompense what Israel hath defrauded YHVH with increase.

23. And whosoever cometh into Israel, a tenth of all they possesses shall they give, that they might have an everlasting inheritance therein; and until they do this, no inheritance shall be given them.

[b] See 3 Nephi 5:92 RAV, 12:48 OPV

6. For these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto soothsaying of times and unto qasamim; but as for thee, YHVH, thy Elohim, hath not suffered thee so to do.

7. ¶ YHVH, thy Elohim, will raise up unto thee a Prophet{a} from the midst of thee of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken,
[a] God calls Joshua to take Moses’ place as the leader and prophet of Israel, other prophets have been called in a variety of rolls from that time forward

8. According to all that thou desiredst of YHVH, thy Elohim, in the day of the assembly{a}, saying: Who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living YHVH speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
[a] See 3 Moses 27:1-8

9. But go thou, Moses, near and hear all that YHVH, our Elohim, shall say; and speak thou unto us all that YHVH, our Elohim, shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it and do it.

10. And YHVH said unto me: They have well spoken that which they have spoken.

11. I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.

12. And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

9. If thou shalt keep all these mitzvoth{a} to do them, which I command thee this day, to love YHVH, thy Elohim, and to walk ever in His ways, then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three,
[a] Hebrew, "calling," "commandment," or "religious duty"

10. And this that innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which YHVH, thy Elohim, giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.

11. ¶ But if any man hateth his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities,

12. Then the Elders of his city shall send, and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

13. And thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.

14. ¶ Thou shalt not remove the landmark of thy neighbor, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that YHVH, thy Elohim, giveth thee to possess it.

15. One witness shall not rise up against anyone for any iniquity or for any sin, in any sin that they sinneth; at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established.

16. And if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong, then both between whom the controversy is, shall stand before YHVH, before the Priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;

17. And the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness be a false witness and hath testified falsely against his brother,

18. Then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother; so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

19. And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

20. And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

1. And when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them;

2. For YHVH{a}, thy Elohim{b}, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, is with thee.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

3. ¶ And it shall come to pass that when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the Priest shall approach,

4. And they shall speak unto the people, and shall say: Hear, O Israel! Ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies; let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble; neither be ye terrified because of them;

5. For YHVH, your Elohim, is He that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.

6. ¶ And it shall come to pass that the officers shall speak unto the people, saying: Who is there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated{a} it?Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it.
[a] A spiritual, religious ceremony where a home is blessed and dedicated to God; see Mezuzah

7. And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet eaten of it? Let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it.

8. And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken{a} her? Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle and another man be with her.
[a] Or "laid with her;" to be with carnally

9. And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say: What man is there that is fearful and faint of heart?

10. Let him go and return unto his house, lest the heart of his brethren faint as well as his heart.

11. And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.

12. ¶ When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace{a} unto it;
[a] We are to always offer peace before battle, avoid conflict whenever possible; see Matthew 5:38-40

13. And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace and open unto thee, then it shall be that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.

14. ¶ And if it will make no peace with thee but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege them.

15. And when YHVH, thy Elohim, hath delivered them into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male{a} thereof with the edge of the sword;
[a] In Kabbalah this refers to our desires to bestow, we slay the wicked desires

16. But the women{a}, and the little ones{b}, and the cattle{c}, and all{d} that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies which YHVH, thy Elohim, hath given thee.
[a] Our desires to receive
[b] Our new desires
[c] Our base desires
[d] All other desires

17. Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

18. ¶ But of the cities of these people, which YHVH, thy Elohim, doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing{a} that breatheth;
[a] Purging all our wicked desires; see Daniel 12:10

19. But thou shalt utterly destroy them: namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites as YHVH, thy Elohim, hath commanded thee,

20. That they do not teach you to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their elohim{a}; so should ye sin against YHVH, your Elohim.
[a] See Elohim of man

21. And when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down to employ them in the siege;

22. Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat{a}, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee until it be subdued.
[a] Or "put to use for the betterment of the people"

1. And if one be found slain in the land which YHVH{a}, thy Elohim{b}, giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him,
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

2. Then thy Elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain;

3. And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the Elders of that city shall take a heifer which hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke;

4. And the Elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the neck of that heifer there in the valley.

5. And the Priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near; for them YHVH, thy Elohim, hath chosen to minister unto Him and to bless in the name of YHVH; and by their word{a} shall every controversy and every stroke be tried;
[a] Or "judgement;" the Priests are also called to be judges over Israel

6. And all the Elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley;

7. And they shall answer and say: Our hands have not shed this blood; neither have our eyes seen it.

8. Be merciful, O YHVH, unto thy people, Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge.

9. And the blood{a} shall be forgiven them.
[a] metaphor for sins

10. So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of YHVH.

11. ¶ And when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and YHVH, thy Elohim, hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,

12. And thou seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife,

13. Then thou shalt bring{a} her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head and pare her nails;
[a] Only with her persmission

14. And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month;

15. And after that, thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

16. And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money; thou shalt not make merchandise{a} of her because thou hast humbled her.
[a] Women are not property

17. ¶ And if a man hath two wives{a}, one beloved and another hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated, and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated,
[a] This may be due to polygamy, the death of the first wife, or divorce

18. Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn;

19. But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.

20. ¶ And if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them,

21. Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the Elders of that city and unto the gate of his place;

22. And they shall say unto the Elders of that city: This, our son, is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.

23. And all the men of his city shall cast him out from among them; so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear and reverence.

24. ¶ And if anyone should committed a sin worthy of death, and they are to be put to death, and thou shall hang that body from a tree,

25. And his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that same day that thy land not be cursed;

26. Curse not the land which YHVH, thy Elohim, giveth thee for an inheritance, defile it not.

14. Then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the virginity of that woman unto the Elders of the city in the gate;

15. And the father of the woman shall say unto the Elders: I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

16. And behold, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying: I found not thy daughter unfaithful; and yet these are the tokens of the faithfulness of my daughter.

17. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city, and the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

18. And they shall amerce him in a hundred shekels of silver and give them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought up an evil name upon a young woman of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

19. But if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel, then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of house of her father;

24. But if a man should force her and lie with her, then the man that lay with her shall die;

[a] A righteous woman
[b] See 5 Moses 20:11- 13, Deuteronomy 19:11-13

4. But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water; and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.

5. ¶ Thou shalt have a place also without the camp whither thou shalt go forth abroad;

6. And thou shalt have a shovel upon thy weapon; and it shall be that when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith and shalt turn back and cover{a} that which cometh from thee;
[a] When there is no latrine, dig a hole and bury the excrement

7. For YHVH{a}, thy Elohim{b}, walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy, that He see no unclean thing in thee and turn away from thee.
[a] See YHVH

10. ¶ There shall be no temple prostitutes from the sons or the daughters of Israel.

11. Thou shalt not bring the hire of a prostitute, be they male or female, into the house of YHVH, thy Elohim, for any oath; for it is detestable{a} unto YHVH, thy Elohim, to prostitute thyself in His name.
[a] This condemns the practice of temple prostitution; see 1 Corinthians 6:15-20

12. ¶ Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother: usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury.

13. Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury{a}; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury, that YHVH, thy Elohim, may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
[a] lending money with interest, particularly unreasonably high rates of interest

14. ¶ And when thou shalt make an oath{a} unto YHVH, thy Elohim, thou shalt not slack to pay it; for YHVH, thy Elohim, will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.
[a] See 4 Moses 17, 5 Moses 9

15. But if thou shalt refrain from making any oaths, there can be no sin in thee.

[a] Don't use false weights or measures to steal, but be honest and use tools proper tools in business; weigh and measure generously so that the customer gets extra

24. For all that do such things and all that do unrighteously are detestable unto YHVH, thy Elohim.

25. And if thou should commit a sin against YHVH, or do an evil thing unto thy fellow man, thou shalt go unto the Priest, wheresoever thou art,

26. And between he and thee alone{a} shalt thou confess unto him, and shalt keep nothing back;
[a] See Matthew 18:15-18

27. And the Priest shall lay upon thee restitution, and penance, and in righteousness shall be thy judge;

21. Then the wife of his brother shall come unto him in the presence of the Elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say: So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.

22. And his name shall be called in Israel: The house of chalutz han-Na’al{a}.
[a] Hebrew, "the house of the Unsandaled" or "the house of he who removed his shoe;" this law was likely put in place to avoid situations as seen in Genesis 38:7-26, where the woman goes to extremes to avoid adultery when rejected by her husband’s brothers

[a] See Jacob 2:2:32-46 RAV, 2:23b-35b OPV

33. ¶ Thou shalt not put away thy husband or thy wife but for adultery; the adulterer and the adulteress that shall not repent is corrupt, for these have been given over to the corruptions of their flesh{a}, that her belly may swell and her thigh rot, and he be found dead in his tent;
[a] See 4 Moses 44:24-34

34. And that these be a warning and a proverb: If these should repent in dust and ashes for a long time, they may be forgiven; yet if the bill of divorcement hath been given, then is she not thy wife;

35. If ye would be one flesh, thou shalt marry again.

36. ¶ Thou shalt not lie with the wife of thy neighbor; for it is loathsome;

37. Neither shalt thou take her to wife; she cannot be thine; and if he stone thee to death, no man shall hinder: thou shalt not be avenged; what he doeth, he shall do speedily in his passion against thee.

38. ¶ Thou shalt offer up thy daughter in marriage while she is yet young; and if thou give her not till she hath been in her prime, she may give herself in marriage; thou hath been found neglectful, and shalt not prevent her.

39. Likewise, thou shalt take a wife to thy son while he is yet young; yet not in his infantile impotence;

40. And thou shalt take for him one that he loveth, and who loveth him; if thou doest it not, when he hath been grown seven years he may take one to himself and thou shalt not prevent him.

41. Shouldest thou covenant to marry a woman, be she young or old, thou shalt not break thy covenant; thou shalt not draw back from thy promise;

42. ¶ And if thou lie with a woman, and she conceive seed of thee, thou shall love her, and shall take her to wife; thou shalt not bring her shame upon her;

43. And if thou should abandon her, and her brethren shall stone thee, and none shall deliver thee; and yet thou shalt be judged for thy faithlessness;

44. And if she be thy servant, or the daughter of thy servant, and her brethren fear thee, the hand of the Elders shall be against thee; thou shalt not corrupt the poor, nor bring shame upon them.

chapter-aka: Inheritance

1. And again{a}, if thy brother have an inheritance, and die leaving a wife, but no seed, thou shalt take her to wife, and raise up seed to thy brother, that his name be not lost among this people;
[a] See 5 Moses 25:17

2. And thou shalt possess the inheritance with her, till the seed{a} be grown up to possess it;
[a] The male child

3. And if he had but a portion, it shall be thine, and the seed also.

4. But, if she love thee not, or thou wilt not take her, this right goeth to the next{a} kinsman; but no one shall take the inheritance or portion without her.
[a] See Luke 20:27-40

5. ¶ Moreover, if thou takest a widow in marriage, and she have been joined to another for time and eternity, thou shalt only take her for life{a};
[a] The deceased husband has no say in the matter and implies that a widower would have the same restriction; see DoS 17e:19-20

6. And should ye{a} bare seed before you have been married a full year, it shall be expressly determined whose the seed is; whether thine, or the husband whose widow she is.
[a] The man and woman

7. And if thou should marry a wife having children, and they have no father in the Kingdom, and she bring them to thee, they are thine; thou shalt receive them, and establish them.

8. ¶ If a woman, be she young or old, obtain a good report through faith, and is chosen of YHVH{a}, thy Elohim{b}, to be a queen{c} and a ruler over her house, she shall have an inheritance appointed to her, with her husband or her brethren, that she may possess it, and her children with her, and that she may rule over all her house.
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim
[c] While much of this book seems to put women in a place of ownership, this text reminds Israel that women are queens and were and may be rulers, just as well as men

9. ¶ And should a man die leaving sons, his inheritance shall belong to them, and it may be parted among them;

10. And to the firstborn, or he that is worthy to be so reckoned, shall be given a double portion, that he may keep up the dignity of his father’s house.

11. The sons which he hath adopted shall be reckoned with the sons he hath begotten; they are his;

12. However, if any of his sons have received an inheritance{a} already, they shall not receive another portion with their father’s children.
[a] See Luke 15:11–32

13. ¶ None shall receive two inheritances, lest their neighbor have none; yet if they should receive another, or if he marry an heiress, they shall surely give up the former, that it may be given to they who hath none, or who lacketh a portion.

14. ¶ And should a man die having no sons, but daughters, the inheritance shall belong to them;

15. And they who shall take them to wife, shall be called after the name of their fathers, every man after the name of his wife’s father: otherwise they shall not possess the inheritance.

16. But if he have neither sons nor daughters, and he be found a righteous man, then may the judge appoint his nearest kinsman who is found worthy, and is not the firstborn of his father, as his heir;

17. And he who is thus appointed shall be called after the name of him who had no child; thus shall the name of his house be kept up;

18. If not, then shall the judge take of his inheritance give it unto they who are in need of it.

19. ¶ If anyone should abandon their inheritance, that it be left to decay and waste, or become wild, that the portion of the house of YHVH, and the treasury of the land fail, then shall the rulers over that land take possession of it, and grant it to those in need, that their wants be met;

20. But should the sons of he who has left his inheritance return, the shall shall render it unto them;

21. And if that portion has been granted to another, then shall they be given another inheritance.

22. ¶ And should any desire to leave their inheritance and seek a place in another land which YHVH, thy Elohim, giveth, then shall they render to the rulers of that land their inheritance,

23. And these shall appoint him another inheritance, that his children may possess it instead of the former, and his house and his name be not lost among Israel.

24. ¶ And should Israel seek men to go up to a new land to possess it by the command of YHVH, your Elohim, then shall the sons among you go up and establish their houses,

25. And their names shall be named upon their inheritances, that they may be kept up forever; and these shall not inherit with their brethren of the possessions of their fathers.

26. Thus shall everyone have an inheritance, or a portion, and they shall not be divided till they are too small for you.

27. ¶ If an inheritance hath been divided, and one who hath a portion should die leaving no child, or render it up to receive another, it shall not be given to a stranger to his house; but it shall return to the head of the family to whom the inheritance pertaineth.

28. And should they die leaving no sons, but a daughter, and any of her kinsman who has also a portion of that inheritance take her to wife, he shall have her portion with her;

29. Save it be be that she obtain a good report through faith, and is chosen of YHVH to be a queen{a} and a ruler over her house, then she shall have an inheritance appointed to her that she may rule over all her house.  
[a] See 5 Moses 26:8

1. And when thou art come unto the land which YHVH{a}, thy Elohim{b}, giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, thou shalt not abide in the conversations of the ungodly;
[a] See YHVH
[b] See Elohim

2. The corrupt desires of deceitful lusts; as an old{a} man unchanged; but shalt be renewed in the spirit of thy heart; that thou be a new person, born{b} anew in righteousness and true holiness.
[a] See Ephesians 4:21-32
[b] See Mosiah 11:187-188 RAV, 27:25-26 OPV

3. Wherefore, thou shall put away all lying: speak everyone truthfully unto their neighbor; let no corrupt communication proceed out of thy mouth;

4. But that which is good, and edifying, and increasing faith ye shall speak; that it may minister grace to the hearers and that ye grieve not YHVH, thy Elohim.

5. Put away thy anger, thy wrath, thy bitterness, and any malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as YHVH hath forgiveth you, walking together in love.

6. ¶ The primary authority over every child is the mother; the authority in any household is the patriarch of the family, the head of the house; to him let all give heed; but the Torah{a} is over all.
[a] Hebrew, "Law," "Instructions," or "Teachings"

7. And should the patriarch die, his firstborn son is head in his stead;

8. Nevertheless, in the dwelling, he shall not rule over the matriarch{a}, nor his mother, nor the mother of his brothers; he shall honor them all the days of his life.
[a] While much of 5 Moses seems to put women in a place of ownership, this text reminds Israel that women are queens and were and may be rulers, just as well as men. See 5 Moses 26:8

9. ¶ As it is written, thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother all thy days; thou shalt not depart from them, nor rebel against them;

10. Thou shalt abide with them, except they send thee away with a blessing; that thou mayest build them up, or be established by thine own name.

11. And thou shalt seek to establish thy sons; thou shalt build them up with thee, or part them a portion of thine inheritance, as shall be meet, that they may grow up, and in their honor bring honor to thee.

12. ¶ And of the widows, or the little children, or the servants, or any members of thy household, thou shalt provide for them according to their station, and thy possessions.

13. If thou and thy household should do it not, they shall go before the Elders and the judge, and these shall appoint them their portion, as shall be just; but the inheritance shall remain one;

14. Over the inheritance the firstborn shall have the highest portion; and his portion shall be double.

15. And if anyone, having a portion, divideth it among his posterity, he need not to respect the firstborn; they shall do as seemeth them good.

16. But if thy firstborn is not worthy to keep up the dignity of thy household, and thou wilt abase him, and exalt another in his stead, thou shalt bring him before the judges at the judgmentseat of the city, and show what evil he hath done;

17. And if thou clearly show that he is unworthy, and that the other is worthy, the judge shall declare it; and then it shall come to pass that thou shalt abase him, and adopt the other;

18. But if thou hast neglected to instruct him, and to restrain him, then so too shall the judge declare it, and thou shalt not abase him; the sin shall be upon thy head.

19. ¶ Thou shalt not sell thy daughter; thou shalt in no case take a price for her in marriage;

20. But thou shalt endow her of raiment, and goods, and flocks, according to thine ability; and thou shalt give her in marriage only to whom she loveth, and who is worthy;

21. Yea, thou shalt not give her to a stranger, nor to anyone that despises the Torah of YHVH, nor to a blasphemer{a}.
[a] One who is ungrateful to God, speaks against God

22. ¶ And everyone may give a portion to their children, a dowry to his wives, and a possession to his servants, while he liveth; and except it is manifestly unjust, the judge shall not change it after their death;

23. As it shall be determined by their last blessing, so shall it be; and if it be made sure before, it shall not be changed.

24. ¶ The rulers, yea they who have a great possession for an inheritance, according to their dignity, shall reserve a portion according to his dignity to the firstborn:

25. And to their other sons shall they give portions as common men that they seek not to make rulers of them all.

26. And should a ruler have servants, and they eat not their bread at his table, he shall appoint them their portions, in his inheritance, that they hunger not:

27. And upon his inheritance he shall be as a father to them; but he shall not exact more than a tenth of them, and it shall be as a tithing of all.

8. ¶ Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor of the fatherless nor take a widow's raiment to pledge;

14. ¶ Then thou shalt say before YHVH, thy Elohim: I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy mitzvoth{a} which thou hast given me; I have not transgressed thy mitzvoth; neither have I forgotten them.
